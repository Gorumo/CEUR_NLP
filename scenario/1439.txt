Higher density massing is placed next to the road, continuing existing street wall experience. Two vehicle/EVA access is placed further from road intersection, each on different side of the road. These vehicle access are emphasized with different treatment of building massing (higher density, unique configuration). The internal vehicle/eva access is planned to be a loop road locating in the first layer from the perimeter block massing. Main public space is planned in the center of the cluster with several pocket spaces inside the compound. These compounds and pocket spaces are well connected among each of them with provision of pedestrian-only access. Smaller building blocks are placed in the inner part of the cluster for a more human-scale space.
