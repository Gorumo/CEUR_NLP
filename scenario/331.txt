This second version improves accessibility to the left corner of the neighbourhood and connect the inner spaces. If later on there is need for expansion it can always be used for new buildings.
Tried to avoid exposure to North because of winds. Also wanted accessibility, given that there is some kind of market to the West and schools to the East. Besides, for safety it's important that all houses have good access to main roads.  The largest internal area can be a main square for the community (with several uses, e.g. a football field for kids to play). This may also be used for further expansion. Also wanted that people could have these inner squares/ gardens, which are more private as they are mainly for the buildings that surround them (potentially including parking spaces, or used as agricultural lots). Taller buildings are off the main roads not to block the view of smaller buildings (though this is debatable). I left a gap to the back (left side) for future expansion. Since these are shacks I assume most people walk, bike or have motorcycles. For pedestrians (as well as ventilation) I left small gaps in between buildings so people can walk through and have even better access to the whole neighborhood.
