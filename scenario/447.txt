What I tried to do here is to create courtyards, to offer residents private space as much as possible while they can feel the atmosphere of being one part of community and being approved as a member, and to avoid the isolation from the other areas outside of this district. I think people sometimes really need to be alone and have their own time and space, but on the other hand, we tend to feel secure by excluding others and establishing our community in a clearly physical way. Therefore, I think it is important to design things one-center-oriented and at the same time, make a lot of hidden spots as long as we can keep the connectivity and accessibility.  This proposal is meant to be very open to the main roads around this concerned area and to fit these all buildings together in one harmony.
