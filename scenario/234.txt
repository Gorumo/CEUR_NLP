I tried to make a mixture between different public spaces - squares - and interconnecting streets in a way that every unit is part off both. Some squares are more private and hidden, others are connected to the existing fabrique offering links between old and new.
Now there is also a mixture between 'high, low, big and small and different colors (although i have untill now no idea about their meaning) to generate a sort of randomness (instead of modern planning grids)
