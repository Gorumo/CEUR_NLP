Updated design scheme on 28-09-2016 --The Design Grid  with the previous Design Scheme of having Two Site Entrances to the project.The shared courtyard spaces with  different building typologies are added.Negative  open spaces created at the end of the site ,can be converted to private cluster open spaces.Open spaces can be shared or  used for various social interaction and playground areas.Based on my previous Design, i have tried to modify my interlocking  road patterns.For the design i have consider a  unit  block of square as a Road  for access to the structure .i kindly request  my peers to kindly rate  my design !!
