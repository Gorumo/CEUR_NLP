It is important to create clusters inorder to define communities. This arrangement allows for creation of urban green spaces within the settlements. Hierachy is also important so the tallest structures were centered so that they can be viewed from various points. Since this neighbourhood connects to other neighbourhoods, it was important to link it to the rest of the area hence the permeability along the boundaries.
