The main idea is to keep the character and the qualities that this urban layout has. Those are the social areas inside the neighborhood and the irregularity of the order. My intervention adds orthogonal layer to the objects, so the organization won't be that chaotic creating a lot of geometrically clear mini plazas inside the neighborhood. The design criteria is based on connectivity and accessibility.
