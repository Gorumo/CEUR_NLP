This development is based on having as much green space as possible by having a mixed planning approach and maximizing overall connectivity and accessibility through green space. 
Every apartment block is connected to the other through a network of parks which are linked to large green spaces to build a "forest city" atmosphere. 
This provides various health benefits and promotes bicycle and pedestrian transportation and interconnectivity. 
The numerous benefits of green areas, such as improved health, reduced stress, reduced high temperatures will thus be maximized for all citizens. 
Roads and water bodies are also dotted with parks to make buffers from cars and maximise the beauty of water landscapes for all. 
In addition to this, thanks to all this green area, the idea is to promote an important urban agriculture movement where many families can work on collective farms and thus improve their health, wellbeing and nutrition.  
Finally, the high number of parks and the mixed use of land improved the walkability and of the city as well as the use of bicycle for transport, this will further reduce pollution and improve the over health and quality of life of residents.
