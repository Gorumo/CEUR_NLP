The purpose of this design proposal is to provide separate living space for the residents while leaving a spacious courtyard for common gatherings. It can be achieved by creating the outer "U-shape" of apartment blocks slightly higher (vertical building) than the inner => reduced number of separate buildings and a gorgeous view + more space for garden, playground and relaxation area. In general, the U-shape of the apartment blocks is meant to protect from strong winds, create a place for residents to relax (courtyard) and simply reduce the traffic and everyday's noise from streets.
