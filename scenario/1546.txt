The reason I chose this layout is becauseI thought that it would be nice to have a large community recreational space like a swimming center as well as a playground and possibly a small square to hold weekly farmers markets or small performances. Though the downside may be a lack of privacy between neighbors, the idea behind the general area is that of a very inclusive community.
