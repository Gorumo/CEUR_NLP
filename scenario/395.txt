My idea of this design are:
1.	to create a harmony community;
2.	air ventilation comfortable for each house;
3.	every house has maximum own front door area;
4.	a public area in the community for children and old people;
5.	cars and emergency automobiles can come in and go out easily;
6.	easy house numbering for government planning, postman and new visitors;
7.	safety if come home late in the night;
