First Proposal.
This organization responds to a smaller cellule of block. It allow a more controlled shared spaced for each cellule.. It`s based on a concept of mini squares for a few houses, were the people can have urban garden, and recreative spaces, making a easier maintenance. There are halls to conect them to each other. In the border the houses controll the access to the street, becoming a boundary to the exterior.
