2nd draft. Quite difficult but going for a more organised zone compared to that of the vids. Within a few spacial pockets, there could be a small shrubbery to incorporate green life in zone. I preferred to put high rise buildings to the back as potential shade, etc but it also gives better design appeal. I imagine this as a living sector of the city, similar to my life with my city, Castries.
