Taking into account the 3 notes regarding Singapore, I thought of prioritizing the margin for interconnected parks, making possible a future connection with the right region of the analyzed area.
I also worried about the ocean view, positioning lower density buildings closer, while the taller buildings were positioned further away from the sea, allowing better appreciation of the local landscape.
Finally, I placed different types of buildings in the extreme regions of the place, with offices at the borders, being close to commercial, residential and mixed use buildings.
