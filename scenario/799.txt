The inspiration for this design comes from Ole Scheeren's Interlace in Singapore [http://buro-os.com/the-interlace/]. 

Instead of having a structured order with straight lines of houses, this is a pure residential area with the purpose of creating a high level of livability and areas to relax, mingle and be private. This is achieved by hard borders to the surrounding areas, while creating common areas between the buildings, which can also be used by people from outside. To make the living experience private, secure and with great views, there are no acute angles at the connections between the single buildings. Thereby, attractive common areas are created, air flow is smoothly guided along long running lines to achieve a cooling effect and privacy is given by long lines of sight between the single housing units. This effect can even be greater by a bigger variety in the heights of the houses, but unfortunately I didn't find a way to adjust the heights in this user interface.

One more thought: Car traffic and a parking spaces should not be allowed in this residential area to make it pedestrian and bicycle friendly. Creating good access to public transport is important and underground car parks should be built close to the major road network.
