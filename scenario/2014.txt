I try to create public open space on the seaside, so most of the area cover by green recreation areas, to prevent gentrification i try to make soft edges between social housing-HDB- luxury housing, there is a clear separation between levels of the building but it has already exist before the design, so I let it continue and there is obvious green linkage between this two different level district.
