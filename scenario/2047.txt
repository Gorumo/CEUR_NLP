up-graded version. I tried to design 2 main green belts (probably the combination of road and park ). And I make the differences between low-dense areas and high-dense areas. Most importantly, I placed the typologies with considering the building heights to keep the ocean view to the direction of south-east to increase the estate value/place. As for the shapes of buildings, I put together the buildings that  have many curves to create some landmarks and to connect these buildings by bridges.
