My proposal was to create an environment where the community and the residents could use as a living and healthy area. 
I considered three main points as a base.

At the first point, it was placed the largest number of buildings parallel to the main streets of access to the square. It is possible to have a smarter densification, with a greater number of eyes on the streets and can coexist sharing the backyard to contribute to public safety. 

The second point was to create access through pedestrians-only streets, that make the extension of other existing streets and to make easier access, not only for residents but for the community in general. 

The third point was to create a internal square / green area, creating a micro-climate and a space to catalyze social interactions, it can inspire a range of uses and activities. This internal square ensures visibility, permeability and social integration to the square.
