Hello, 
Considering Land values and urban needs, I have tried to create cluster formations in which communal activities can happen and we can give it back the other land for other future planning and for a better quality of life. Considering contextual behaviour, I have tried to put the blocks and position of it in such a way that it has a certain degree of communication and it allows communication with context blocks.Meanwhile, Considering North orientation, I have tried to put the block in a way that they will get proper light as well as ventilation. Meanwhile, Government can propose other facilities for residents in another land area.
