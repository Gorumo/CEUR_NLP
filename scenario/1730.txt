The concept is based ot the organisation of the neighbourhood in 3 large groups, subdivided in smaller entities. This granularity creates the communication lines on north-south axis, and large, intimate spaces between living units. While western blocks are designed for living, the eastern block is suitable for more public activities, with large green area on the south. Intimate spaces are separated from the main road by building, providing secure and pleasant area. The linear alignment of small blocks, inside groups, is conditioned by the form of standard living unit. The spaces between those living units are used for urban gardens, leisure area and community's common activities.
