First of all, I try to build smaller-size communities in the neighbourhood for people's easier mingling. Second, I pave space for public space and other community buildings that might be needed in the future. Some blocks in the east corner (bottom left) were built for people who may not like getting to close to public space (maybe due to noises or simply sort of a personality) Third, accessibility is a concern. A corridor is purposely extended from the crossroad (upper left) as the main entrance, while a couple of other access to the road are open. It is also partly for security reason as open space are indeed safer because of the visibility. There is no information on weather or sunlight and windflow provided so all I can do is assuming sunlight is rare  from the north. Thus higher buildings were put facing the north and west so that they won'y block the sunlight from the south and east. They will also help block the sunset heat on the entire neighbourhood. environmental measures and special design would be needed to help residence inside to resist the heat though.
