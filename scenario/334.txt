This layout aims to offer substantial visibility with its multiple open spaces that offer generous public spaces as well as communal spaces within the inner court yards.

The abundance of space, both public and private, offers optimal conditions to stimulate social interactions in the neighborhood as well as a perception of safety.

The openings are axed towards the surrounding urban reality such as the nearby office buildings and the school.  These connections aim at enhancing the sentiment of continuity and promotes pedestrian circulation via desired lanes.

One can expect the community to take advantage of the communal space for gardening, urban farming and social gatherings thus enhancing the neighborhoodâ€™s quality of life.
