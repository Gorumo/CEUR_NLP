The site is connected from the primary local intersection in the south east by a pedestrian spine leading to the pedestrian crossing at the primary school.  There are five semi-courtyard schemes from which each individual dwelling is assessed.  There are two main public areas. one to the north across from the secondary school and a second to the south east which benefits from more shade and it would be envisaged that these serve the wider surrounding community for markets, socialising or other community gatherings. There are two lesser sized public areas at the intersections of the mini-districts designed to encourage passing interaction with other members of the wider community who use these pedestrian routes.  The space within the each section are proposed to be community quiet zones for the benefit of the residents these spaces are enclosed by.
