The goal of this plan is to design spaces with a mix of concept of superblocks opened to big squares and some flexibility in the shape giving opportunity to the citizens to crossing the blocks encountering differentes scenes, perspectives and green places. Different ways to run through the blocks (4 acesses) and stimulating living spaces - in other hand, we provides too with this plan quiet areas to the residentes in the center of some closed squares. In the edge of this plan and squares, in face of the streets and acess we can have more shoppings and offices, in the center we can have more residences. The project with this aspects intend to provide a place with intercommunication, interaction and centrality.
