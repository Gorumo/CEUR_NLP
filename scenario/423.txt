An African village that is build into a series of communities within the larger context of a community with  interior courtyards provide space for people to gather, grow vegetables, have play and outdoor areas .  The large 2 story houses are shown along the back of the site de-marking this community from the others around it. The houses are varied in size to provide variety and visual appeal due to their relationship to one another.  The corner building has been set back providing an opportunity for a more formal entrance way into the site.    I see this community as celebrating  and pointing back to more traditional African villages
