Hey all! I have attempted to provide intimate open spaces throughout the site. Even as most units face the streets, slightly unique and personal spaces are created for residents to identify with and personalize and expand in as per their desire and mutual understanding with neighbors. The focus was to create organic spaces of distinct nature. Do share your opinion!
