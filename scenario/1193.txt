The layout proposed is based on a series of fundamental considerations - Orientation of each unit is along the north south axis so as to optimize use of lighting, the taller units are placed along the south-west edges of the site to prevent penetration of harsh light into the open spaces. Arrangement of units on the site, further facilitate movement of wind through the site. 
The south-east and south west corners are left empty for parking and therefore restricting vehicular access. Thus pedestrian movement is given more dominance primarily due to lack of open spaces in the area. The open spaces are also sectioned off to provide zones for different age groups/ activities. They also serve as a large spill out for various levels of interactions and the spaces could also be used as a venue for workshops, exhibits and other community gatherings.
The location of the entries are designed for ease of accessibility to the nearest schools and complexes.
Finally, due to the north-south orientation of each unit, an informal front yard to each unit can be incorporated specially on the inclined edges of the site, thus defining the edge condition as well.
