By moving as little buildings as possible in order to follow an upgrading approach, I propose to create a south to north-east  access road. The road imporves accessibility for public services but preserves a neighborhood character in the two densely built areas, which will be accessible partly by foot, partly directly through adjacent streets. In the center of the access road, plaza will create centrality in terms of community and visibility.
