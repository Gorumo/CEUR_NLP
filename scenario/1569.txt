The initial plan is to order the houses so there can be a park in front of the primary and secondary schools, this way children can spend time and play after their classes. Also, the proposal is to generate  two sidewalks parallel to the vechicle streets that get to the schools. These sidewalks will be between the houses and the park, so children can get save from car accidents  to the school.
