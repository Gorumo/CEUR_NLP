Courtyard Country:
The layout is designed in a way to improve community cohesion or social cohesion by creating common spaces between the blocks, hence the name "Courtyard Country" where common activities could be performed.  Front yard and back yard for the residential block are also taken care and also there is a clear demarcation between public, semi private and private spaces. Most dense or tall blocks enjoys the main access road and also act as a factor of safety by looking over and around the streets thereby reducing crimes. Considerable open space in the middle of the neighborhood provides multi usable space which could be used to play, green space/lawn, farming, cultural activities, parking, even to host seasonal/temporary market despite of the courtyard type of blocks.

Such blocking and spacing would have a positive impact over the environmental quality of the neighborhood, which optimistically opens up to so many opportunities right from economy, employment, quality of life etc with efficient awareness and sufficient guidance.  

Even there is a difference in height and forms of the blocks playing contrast quality, movements are clear and creating here and there effects, and there is a real scope, for the self sufficiency (urban agriculture), character and identity of the neighborhood. On a next level of  design these design objectives and their actions could be elaborated. 

Looking forward.
Thanks
