My idea of ​​layout is to create a system of urbanization where each group of houses create a micro-cloister that closes its facade to the streets, to continue with the profile of the rest of the blocks of this neighborhood, but also each of these cloisters are closed to each other to create semi public spaces and voids to allow the lighting and ventilation of each of the living spaces.
Each cloister acts in relation to the others cloisters mirror, creating a pattern along the terrain ground, where there are open public spaces for every housing and other semi-public spaces and larger entrances to the main void, Which are communicated, one with Av. Jongo, giving it front and open space to the primary and secondary schools that are passing the street and another entrance to the other side of this, corresponding to the  Mendi street, which is existing; Thus creating a system of diverse circulations throughout the terrain, that converge in this central public space central scale.
I also think that this type of urbanism can be correct solution, because as a Colombian I know how is the behavior of this type of communities is and I also know how important it is for them to live in community, have relationships between neighbors, markets, etc. So placing the houses apart from one another or putting them together in a single block is not the solution, or leaving a large empty space (for a central square or park) in the center, where the houses are around it, making a circle, in a City like CapeTown, it will became uninhabitable by the sun, so with small groups of houses not only preserves life in community, but the shade  is guaranteed all year long and they can enjoys public space within the same block.
Note: It is important to point out that, since we are targeting for future cities, I doesen´t opted for the creation of parking lots or internal streets, since it is expected that, although the cars will not disappear, people will become aware and decrease their use.
