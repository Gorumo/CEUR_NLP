A design has been proposed where buildings with increased resident density compensate for Singapore's limited land availability. Social housing is favored since that would allow more citizens to have access to housing. Additionally, due to Singapore's hot and humid climate urban heat island effects due to urban design need to be mitigated. For that reason, buildings close to each other could potentially "trap" heat within the area and are, thus, avoided. Favored are buildings with skybridges and vegetation, the latter even helping to lower temperatures in the area. Finally, low-rise buildings are favored for the southeastern part of the district to avoid blocking the view to the sea. Of course, additional considerations would have to be made to account for the winds in the area and the corresponding adjustments to the buildings' spatial position due to that factor.
