The area is divided into three building zones that form an inner (court) or a gathering space that can be used as a small green area. and by creating a road between the zones we can ensure that all inhabitatnts have a house that is easily accessible with a view and a surrounding space to be used as an individual garden.
Also the buildings are arranged by size so the small families occupy the eastern part of the land, and in the middle zone there is a central building that can serve as a school or a shopping center.
