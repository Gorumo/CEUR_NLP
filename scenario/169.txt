The spine scheme generates these spaces in between the lines for socialization, expansion or possible community farming or just a line of perennial trees to protect from the sun during summer. At the same time having space between constructions lines provide enough room for shadows that the houses project towards the South.  All houses assume the entrance and windows to the good orientation that is North in the South hemisphere. Therefore the entrances are towards Njongo Avenue where a High School is. It was assumed also that Maphongwanas Avenue collect some car traffic that is why the (2) story houses are locate along this Avenue.
In order to increase the connectivity between the houses as well as the interior pedestrian circulation a street  align with the crossing lines on Njongo Avenue, assuming that the High School across the street will provide a big volume of people.
