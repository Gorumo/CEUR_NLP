The main idea behind the project is to make the whole district walkable from east to west and vice versa, green areas are distributed parallel to the waterfront to take the breeze from the waterfront and bring it further towards offices and higher density mixed-use spaces. Furthermore, distribution of cultural attractions is almost even along area leading users and visitors around avoiding huge gathering of people in one region. Areas around mixed-use spaces situated closer to the waterfront are not blocked from public use by park connectors, therefore, visitors to the area can enjoy both waterfront and cultural attractions. Office spaces are pushed to the north, however, green areas and water bodies closer to this area can improve the workflow of employees due to visual connection with nature or opportunity to have a walk during the break.
