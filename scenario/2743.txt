This is my proposal for Tanjong Pagar container terminal.
Not much to say it's all in the drawing...
I'm a big fan of mixed use neighbourhoods, although in this case, some high density residential is necessary.
There are some "Navigli" type channels, and on the right side, towards the remaining container terminal, a possible grow is taken into account.
There's also, a green continuity from the waterfront towards Mt. Faber Park.
Please feel free to comment on this proposal.
