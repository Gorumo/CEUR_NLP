First, I tried to think about the types of land use for the area. As I observed on Google Maps, in that neighboorhood, there's a big commercial activities, so, I tried to mix with residential buildings, a theme park, cultural attractions and green areas. I also tried to divide the buildings in three areas that go changing from the shopping mall Vivo to the other side of the area, on the east. In the first area there are a city park sorrounded by high density mixed use building, offices with a lake, green areas and residential buildings. The second area is more like an entertainment area, with a theme park and a cultural attraction, but with residential buildings to give some people movement on the streets on different periods of the day, so the streets get more safe for pedestrian traffic. The last area has a higher density, with offices, commercial buildings and a culture attraction with paved open space sorrounded by green areas, where people can take music lessons or dance, cross the street and have an ice cream in the commercial building by the beach.
