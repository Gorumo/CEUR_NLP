My design focuses on maximization of accessibility and open spaces. Thus I have proposed a two way entry exit and central park accessible by all. The outer periphery houses are at setback of 4-5 m from the streets to allow for parking and footpaths.The inner street is proposed to be 12 meter wide to allow for guest/ inner resident parking as well as avenue plantation. The spacing between each houses will allow for future upgradation of the units.
