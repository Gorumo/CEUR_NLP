I designed the trapezoidal Khayelitsha property in building groups with dynamically patterned themes and variations. The themes are two-fold: public-facing street domiciles that hybridize live-work with integrated livelihood on the ground floor; and interior community living clusters. The building clusters are grouped to evoke African geometric and pictographic imagery, placed along one central and four secondary axes. The community functions as a campus whose residents steer its living, work and ecology. The goal is a neighborhood supporting its residents' culture with creative functionality and amenities, fostering sustainability and stewardship.

Lining the two streets along the community edges are block-length domiciles with safe visibility along street lines and into interior axes. They are a visual-sound buffer for buildings to the interior. The buildings along each street have centered symmetrical form that is similar to yet differentiated from each other. This approach is to give the village a public-facing aspect to share its industry and present a vibrant street presence and identity. By using a modest setback and creating a further opening into the community at their intersection, the buildings are placed such that their access points to the interior are endpoints for the primary axis. Therefore, the secondary axes perpendicular to it have ample space around the building clusters. This balances vital circulation and spatial integration that is functionally and aesthetically appealing for the residents' social lives. Here, homes are intended to offer neighbors creative isovists from indoors or outdoors, whether walking, or stationary but looking around. The corner entrance to the community, in contrast, enters the largest open space intended for ecological stewardship opportunities such as agricultural or product production, leisure and other activities.
