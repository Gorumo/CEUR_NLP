Wishing I have more control over the tools, but I guess that's the reality in designing and planning that involve collective ideas. This proposal is a response on how the external existing factors can influence the layout. Through multiple configuration, accessibility and connectivity between areas surrounding the site should improve. By maximizing the space between units, multiple plazas can be created. Buildings height were also arranged so that every unit can obtain sufficient sunlight (although in some places its quite small. The size of the grid was not known, unless I missed something)
