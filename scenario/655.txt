the polygonal terrain and buildings studied two levels are implanted in the upper boundary, following the guidelines of the traverse other buildings were implemented keeping distance between them; in order to maintain cross ventilation and privacidad between families. These spaces between blocks serve as walkways between the main roads of the urbanization. It design a main road that makes a diagonal across the area and a secondary linking the principal to urbanization exit. These are parallel and square represent two of the reticle, which can be considered for green and passable space. At the bottom, it adapted to the morphology of the terrain was designed a recreation central plaza  and two of the walkways are directly connected to this. The square is surrounded by buildings of a level.
