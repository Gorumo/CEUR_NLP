A roundish design has been chosen for optimal efficiency as well as elegance. Everyone is at a similar distance from the core of the housing cluster where shops, educational facilities, health and child care facilities are located. In addition, the central area has some space for social interactions. In the vicinity of the three corner points, bigger residence buildings are located as well as caf√©s, restaurants and hobby areas.
