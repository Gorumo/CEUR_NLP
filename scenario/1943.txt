Different aspects make up this design proposal:
1. Roads/pathways: Use of existing Mendi St., adding a new pathway from W-O (accessibility of 'inner' houses). For the NW section, I wanted to created a star-road-layout but due to the limited grid, it is only a 4-corner 'intersection' with the 4 houses in the middle tilted (planned as a gathering area).
2. Housing layout: Google StreetView indicates that many houses have no windows, so, I joined them to build groups and free space. Also, many houses have a 'front yard' (washing line, car parking). Thus, houses are not placed right at the street but moved back.
3. Long-term thoughts: It is important to DESIGN the roads and pathways. Otherwise, there is a risk of new sheds being built 'in between'. There are some spaces left deliberately to allow the family to expand or more families to move in.
