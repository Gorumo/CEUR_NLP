The idea was to try to give some sort of organization in the place. The buildings were grouped by direction to try to create a unified ensemble. A path system in two axes was also created in order to give a character of "address" for the people living in the place. The higher buildings are always placed on the corners or outside faces to create view points that are more representative. in the middle, there is space for gathering such as playgrounds or parks for people to meet and create a neighborhood feeling.
