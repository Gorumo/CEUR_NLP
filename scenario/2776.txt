Since Singapore has a limited land, the density of construction is the main issue. With that in mind, here is proposed a dense neighborhood with as many mixed use buildings as possible, so the city`s functions wouldn`t be segregated and life could be found in all parts of the new settlement. 

The seafront should be destined to people`s use, so a linear park was placed near the water, and a green path was created permeating the  whole project trying to bring the Waterfront Tanjong up until the ocean.
The cultural building were connected to the green space path so in the weekend it can be part of the recreational area. 
Other concern are the build uses that was planned to have offices close to the Sentosa gateway because of the ease access and to protect residential buildings from noise. Also, in front of the 
highway were places high density mixed use buildings to put on the floor level and the noisy commercial function and bring to the upper level the residence that are easily accessed through the highway avoiding to creating larger streets and bringing intense traffic inside of the new area.
