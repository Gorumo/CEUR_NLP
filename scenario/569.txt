For this urban exercise, I tried to create three new axes through the parcel, which lead to a central small public square/park. The new axes generate from 1) the form of the parcel, 2) the existing axes in the city, and 3) as a direct access to the public space.

Inside the parcel the buildings are disposed following a 3 main experimental typologies, allowing to leave private ground to most of them. The first zone, in the front of the parcel, is composed by mostly small and low buildings, shifted from their main organisational line to leave privacy between their private gardens; the second area, at the center of the parcel, is composed on the front by the smallest houses, every one of them with a private space, and on the back by bigger blocks who could share their semi-private space altogether; the third part, is composed by semi- detached double family houses, that share a backyard garden; and finally a longer block facing the public square, which has no private space for itself but can directly benefit from the public garden at the center of the parcel.

--- IMPRECISIONS DUE TO A SOFTWARE PROBLEM ---
As  I explained personally I had to re-do the exercise because of a problem with my Chrome which didn't let me save the exercise the first time I did it.
