As a cluster of 68 residences it is highly important to promote a sense of community at the intern and the neighborhood level (other clusters). The proposal attempts to locate pairs or small number of housing units in a playful manner. The logic behind focuses on creating an open space at the core of the cluster proper of this community. However, also accessible to the adjacent clusters. The continuity of the visual access from a perpendicular road at the side, also emphasize this core area, at the same time that intends to stitch the new distribution of houses to the underlying main urban morphology. The groups of houses facing the roads and the ones behind this ones, are allocated in a way that both groups can have visual access to the core area (houses facing the street) and to the street (houses towards the core area).
