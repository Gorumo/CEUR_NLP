My idea behindehind this project was to allow as much free space between buildings as possible. This would allow planting some trees in the area. It would also allow circulation of the air in the inner parts of the triangle. And finally, some space between buildings would allow maximum privacy for the inhabitants of the houses in the inner parts.
