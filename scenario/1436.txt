The idea of this design is to have it done by starting from large to small. First I wanted that the big plot on which all the volumes will be placed to be divided in such a way that it would not alter its unity, therefore keeping its character of a ''big'' plot. Secondly, the view was focused on creating different smaller plots or blocks, which would be a reproduction of the previously mentioned ''bigger plot'', having them oriented in a more interiorised manner for the western part, which opens through its system of courtyards to the eastern part, where more public buildings/administrative/services etc. buildings could be located.
