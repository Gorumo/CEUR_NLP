First Sketch (still in work):
Square-like structure at the eastern end (towards railway station, taxi stand, supermarket, etc.).
High buildings alongside the "main" road.
North-south alignment for solar irradiation.
Tree line on Mlambo St. to be imagined.
Inner dead-end road with an approx. 90 degree angle to be imagined. Pedestrian path as it's continuation to create a direct connection to the schools in the north.
