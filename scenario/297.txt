I don't get anything done with the blocks themselves, so for now I just have to share some ideas
1) On of my lines of thinking would be using solar energy as well as possible, but we don't know where North is, so that is a problem to place them in the right orientation;
2) another line of thinking would be to create some space for community activity and community building. This will involve placing the highest and longest buildings on the street sides, providing a physical barrier for the noise coming from there. I would place the highest building near the crossing, for orientation;
3) There is little information on the surroundings, so it is difficult to choose vision lines. It would be logical though for the open space to be visible from the street at two places on both neighbouring streets, about halfway;
4) the buidlings could be grouped in three groups in the corners of the field. I thionk 68 buildings is a bit much for people to feel connected. Smaller grouos, like 22 to 24 seems more appropriate.
