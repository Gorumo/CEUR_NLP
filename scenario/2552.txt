i used the city axes for divide en 3 "Macromanzanas"//superblocks the "district" with a green heart each one, i located the tallest volumes in the center of the 3 superblock to increase the density and the movement around the areas, and i tried to  reduced the density in the corners, because normally is where more movement exist  and less tranquility, and with these i reduced a little bit the conflicts in the corners,
