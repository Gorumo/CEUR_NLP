It looks like a mess? Yes! it's supposed tolook like that... I took the approach of two greenway which continue the two main roads coming from inland to the seaside. They will provide view from far away to the ocean. The rest is quite an organic random mix of business, commercial and housing...  That's to have a good mix of a lot of people from all wealth and origins which will create a lively and attractive neighbourhood. Access to water is mostly green except for a few place where there is housing (both categories, less the low rise ones)
