A livable city is a diverse city. 
The overall concept of the redevelopment of the containerdistrict of Tanjong Pagar, Singapore, aims to mix commercial, public, housing and offices in a way, that creates a more lively and vibrant city, that doesn’t risk to “shut down” after normal office hours. 
The new development aims to re-use the potential of the waterfront by adding a public park along the harbour linking the Serena Gateway with future development east of the container terminal. 
Three public parks that form community centres of the new neighbourhood development interrupt the continuous park along the harbour front. Around these public community centres the neighbourhood’s main public functions, commercial spaces and attractions are located.   
Around each centre and along the waterfront park the development consists of dense low-rise residential and mixed-use buildings, angled differently to maximize views towards the harbour. A high building mass density in these areas help the buildings shade each other, which as a result require less cooling loads. The dense building masses also creates smaller, shaded and cooler microclimates in the semi-public neighbourhood parks between the buildings. 
Behind the first row of lower mixed-use and residential buildings and the community centres 1-2 rows of higher density mixed-use, residential and office buildings are formed. These rows of taller buildings are also to be massed to create shading for each other and to create better microclimates. Small community green areas are located in between the buildings.
The highest concentration of office buildings are located north towards the trafficked Keppel Way to shield off the new neighbourhood development from high traffic noise exposure. A green public path connects the Mount Faber park neighbourhood with the new development close to its main entrance at the intersection of Keppel Way and Kampong Bahru Rd.
