Residences are clustered to form common courtyards tucked away from main streets. Openings for the walkways out of each courtyard structure the flow of people in and out to encourage "happenstance" meetings with the flow in and out of other clusters. More public buildings (small shops, services, etc.) directly line some of the main streets on the likely paths to the primary and secondary schools, and themselves face somewhat larger neighborhood open spaces.
