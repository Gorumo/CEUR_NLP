The proposal is structured by 4 fundamental urban parameters:
1)	Centrality
Although we can note a main centrality in the south-east part of the area, with many business and commercial buildings, there are other smaller centralities distributed in the region: almost at each block, among residential buildings, there is a commercial construction (either a “Chinatown” building, with both residential and commercial uses, or a main commercial building). Based on some Jane Jacobs concepts, the purpose behind the creation of a great number of centralities is to generate diversity and identity, as those qualities stimulates spaces that are safer and better preserved by its users and inhabitants.
2)	Accessibility/Connectivity 
The streets and avenues were designed in dialogue with the context. Besides the fact that they were structured based on the already existent streets of the city, their shapes are both parallel and perpendicular to the shape of the seashore, in order to value the view and to promote the ventilation that comes from the sea, as we are talking about a hot weather. Besides this, along the seashore there is a bicycle-pedestrian green way, in order to promote leisure and sustainability.
3)	Visibility
Besides the shape of the streets and avenues, another aspect that values the visibility is the distribution of small buildings next to the seashore and tall buildings far from it. 
4)	Density/Distribution
In order to guarantee a high density, there were placed as much as tall residential buildings as possible, always respecting the sea visibility. Another important aspect is the heterogeneous distribution of luxurious and social-housing buildings, in order to avoid a “socially-segmented” space.
