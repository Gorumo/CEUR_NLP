The design creates 3 corridors in the area. Each block of buildings has sufficient space between for fire safety and clear views over longer axis for safety. The higher buildings are positioned closer to the main road to block noise. There is an open space towards the more quiet part of the area to allow for safe community life outside. Overall, the setup should optimise the connectivity, accessibility and connection of the community, making it one neighbourhood.
