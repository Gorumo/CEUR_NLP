My design Ideas are as followed: 

1) Community Development space (Open area) 

              The open area located more to the Western portion of the Bt Section is designated as a community development space that can be used for several different activities. 
              It can be used to start a community garden that would allow the residents of the community to partially self sustain themselves through the growing of simple agricultural crops. This may even result in the provision of jobs for some residents and will assist in the economic growth in the area, due to the reduce spending cost. 
             Another potential use of this area  is too convert it into a multi-purpose recreational and development zone. This allows for the social development of residents through various activities such as sports, training programms and community concil meetings. 
             It should be noted that this spot was chosen as there is already a road located in this section which can be used for easy access and transportation of goods and people in and out of the community zone. 
            Additional the Houses located within the inner circle should be assigned to the village leaders so that they may monitor and run the development space. 

2) Safety, Health, Access and Comfort. 

               All houses are were position at the suitable set back distance from the road away to allow for the implementation of a buffer zone between the road and the houses. This is to increase the safety of the residents as well as the health which would be negatively influence my the traffic. 
             Houses were also spaced out so that it allows for easy access within the area and too houses as well ass to provide a sense of comfort rather than congestion.
