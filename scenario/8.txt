The design allows for front-and-back views and street usage. Lines of sight from buildings are not obstructed by other buildings where possible. Buildings are spaced to allow for common and multi use spaces, such as playgrounds and green spaces. Longer sight lines are allowed for, both along rows of buildings and from the main street so that a more visually interesting and livable community space can be created. CPTED can be included from the outset of planning to promote security and safety considerations (extended sight lines, design that encourages citizen engagement, visibility, etc.)
