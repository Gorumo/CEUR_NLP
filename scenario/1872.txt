I have tried to make it varied landscape: Mixing different houses together (different people, different needs living together), not making symmetry so it gives a diverse feel and not to planned. I have also tried to make both a centralized public space and decentralized public spaces, so there can be both a small community feeling and a larger one (perhaps there could be a community center and a playing ground). Also along the road I have made space for sidewalk. In regard to Urban Heat Island I have tried to make corridors so the air can circulate better
