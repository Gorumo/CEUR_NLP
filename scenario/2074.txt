My design idea was to create a lot of green outdoor spaces, so that the people would be able to enjoy life outside, and maybe have communal gardens, urban farming as well as many parks with playgrounds, fields to play games and paths to walk, run and bike around on. 
The commerce and business areas are placed along the large highways, as to not have apartment buildings in their place - they would be bothered by all the noise. That way they are placed in calmer, quieter areas.
The lower buildings were placed nearer to the shore, as to give sea view to a higher amount of people.
I tried to have a good mix of social housing and luxury housing as to not have any “social partitioning” in the city, and have a diversity of people from different social, economical and cultural backgrounds in the different public spaces, including schools, cafés etc. This is an urban planning effort to avoid social segregation and all the disadvantages that it ensues.
