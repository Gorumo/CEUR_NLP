This arrangement is inspired by the City of Seoul, South Korea. The high rise buildings are located at the extreme ends of the space so as to avoid obstruction of the low rise buildings from sunlight. in addition, the buildings are generally oriented with the longer sides facing E-W direction to maximize reception of sunlight in the building interiors. There are access roads left between the four blocks buildings to allow enough mobility room of both vehicles and pedestrians. Lastly the empty space left of the right side is intentionally meant to accommodate, religious, educational and/or recreational facilities.
