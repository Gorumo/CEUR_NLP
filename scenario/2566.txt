The Idea  is that all buildings are Clustered in blocks a 5-6 buildings. This allows easy accessibility to all buildings but reduces the density a bit. every block can have an own central buildings , in which there could be a small marked or a community gathering place. I built the tallest buildings in the north to allow sunlight to every building and to have a good visability for everyone.
