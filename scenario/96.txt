Model #2. Empower Shack
Visibility: Because Khayelistha is a city dominated by buildings of just one floor, the Empower Shack has zoned the perimeter of the block with low rise buildings that do not radically change the skyline. The tallest buildings are placed in the inner part of the Empower Shack, in interleaved manner to ensure that all have good lighting and natural ventilation.
Centrality: The Power Shack shares a large central space of  public nature, monitored daily by their inhabitants.
Connectivity: A secondary pathway which coordinates the Empower Shack and allows access to public space has been placed. This route must be of  low vehicular movement and should allow good pedestrian relationship between neighbors through wide trails and gardens.
Accessibility: All the buildings of the Empower Shack have a front to the street, either the perimeter or the interior one. It has been design to minimize roads,  to maximize the usable public space.
