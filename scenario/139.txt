Based on an estate model, this design models the settlement around 6 individual estates around a concentric meeting area, thus allowing for both local interactions within a settlement (dinner with the neighbors) as well as regional interactions. Such management could also help decentralize facilities such as recycling bins to each estate to manage cost while ensuring mass deployment and maximum accessibility
