Hi! I'm Joel Mancol from Philippines. The design I made is based on the Philippine community orientation where neighbors treat each other like their own family members. But for this, houses should be spaced with enough area for plants to grow and neighbors to say "Hi" and "Hello". I emphasized the bigger space in front of the houses along main road (in front of schools) for the safety of the residents as well as not to be constantly breathing on polluted highway. Space at the center with connecting small road from 2 main streets will provide a common park or recreation for this small community.
