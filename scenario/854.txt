The community is carefully laid out to maximize daylighting in interior spaces and improve thermal comfort through the use of courts. High rise buildings are laid out along the major roads this helped to form a boundary for the community, additionally placing high rise buildings along the streets helps with collecting the maximum amount of natural light due to the fairly large width of both streets . The development has two large public spaces and other public spaces that are smaller in size to encourage social interaction. High rise buildings are mixed with smaller buildings to encourage mixed-use areas ( dividing communities according to building size was avoided to prevent separation based on income or social status)
