The settlement is an informal one in a dense locality. The design is based on the idea that the housing is in 3 U shaped clusters to enable enclosure of a community/interactive space. The design ensures connectivity, visibility, accessibility and uniform density amongst all the 3 clusters. Being a dense locality, the central space is freed which could function as the larger community space within and for the surrounding. As required and stated in the brief, the housing proposed are row housing that reduces cost and the interactive and larger community space provides for the entrepreneurship opportunity of the community.
