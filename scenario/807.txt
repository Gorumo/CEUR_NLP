Main features:
1. A large central place is defined in the main entrance of the complex (right side) to serve as a community forum, marketplace, interaction space with the outer world etc.
2. Most large buildings are placed in the outskirts of the demarcated area to protect the inner parts and to host possibly communal or other services.
3. Organic design is adopted for the rest of the buildings with all of them having access (1 or 2 buildings distance) to a close smaller place to allow more intimate and point to point socialization.
4. External openings (spaces between border buildings) do not align with inner ones as much as possible, to enforce a community feeling.
Overall the design is inspired by medieval cities (I have studied Pirenne, Sitte, Benevolo).
