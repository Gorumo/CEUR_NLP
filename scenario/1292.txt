   The concept of the new layout was to create a multipurpose space for integration for the residents; which is why most of the buildings are skirting the terrain. Community gardens, space for physical activities, playground and others, can be created in this free area.
    Three openings were made to allow entry and exit. Such openings are located at the junction of two or more lanes, making the arrival to the location more accessible.
