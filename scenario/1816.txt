3 mixed-use zones - Three zones are separated by boulevards but each zone is united with a centralized open area.   The central area is the free zone where any activity can take place.  It gives each zone its own identity.  They interchange their roles through the year.  One being a park in the summer and another being an exhibition.   Then they become  a  skating rink and a winter market.  People living in the blocks can enjoy city life through the year.
