The HDB & luxurious projects are well distributed along the waterfront in order to create a pleasant residential area as well as to increase the market value of the buildings. The Chinatowns are placed near suitable commercial locations and are also accessible to the HDB. Tiong Bahru are placed closer to the roads with HDB on waterfront.
Also few HDB are placed near the business areas to provide a possibility of accommodation to the employees/workers in the vicinity. All the buildings are easily accessible by road and enough greenery is provided for the entire residential area.

Note: Only the residential area is designed, based on the commercial and business areas that remain undisturbed.
