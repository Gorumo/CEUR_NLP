- I have tried to create a street network through the site.  
- With the utilisation of a street type layout, it also increases security in that neighbouring dwellings will be able to look upon nearby dwellings.
It also gives one point of entry for any vehicles or other such modes of transport from the main road which additionally raises security as there aren't numerous routes onto the site from neighbouring sites or thoroughfares.
- Larger Units have been primarily positioned to the south as the sun passes to the north in the southern hemisphere and would allow maximum day-lighting to all of the units.
- Units along the main road could be utilised as commercial type use if required.
- I have also attempted to position the larger units nearer the front of the site, this will act to improve the prestige and/or profile of the site indicating the bigger units where they are likely to be seen by the most people will create interest.
