We need tp know but we do not have yet information about social, personal, cultural, economical aspects of the inhabitants, as well as local regulations, or cultural perceptions, for example, the use of attached houses reduces cost but needs to be attractive to inhabitants. we need to know weather conditions and accessibility for materials.
