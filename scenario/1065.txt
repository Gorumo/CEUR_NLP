IRREGULAR - STRUCTURED - CREATING THE UNEXPECTED
These three phrases are the concepts that define the spaces of the "island" to be designed.
A grid will be superimposed over the irregularly shaped site, that will organize, through a predefined rule, both the built and unbuilt spaces.
Then, for creating the common spaces, the main streets detach from the grid, tying adjacent existing streets. Thus they become "unexpected moments" in the grid and help configure less rigid common spaces that any inhabitant can appropriate  based on personality.
The shape of the proposed site offers the possibility of creating multiple types of public spaces (private, semi-private, public) depending on openness to their surroundings. Therefore: the north-west side of the site, the narrow area represents the opportunity for a public space open to the whole city, like a park, or plaza; while the interior of the island, at the intersection of the main streets, a more intimate type of space is created, as it is surrounded by local residences. 
The private yards are regulated and well defined, being the "base cell" of the grid.
