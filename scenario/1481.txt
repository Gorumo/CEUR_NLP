The main idea of this model is to provide housing together with public spaces in order to result in a liveable and quality place. The blocks are distributed along the borders of the quadra with several access points through and to its interior, which is to be a public space that can be used by the neighborhood as well as the school located beside if needed. The positioning of the blocks also enables the use of the smaller spaces for more private purposes.
