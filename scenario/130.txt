The arrangement for the cluster of houses is made keeping in view the grid at most places. The middle spaces in between the land can be used to have roads or streets in combination with green belts to give an idea of a green or sustainable community. In between each lane, space is left to accommodate user traffic or for information architecture provision such as street lights.

Overall the spaces are arranged so that an inclusive community is formed which is neither too crowded nor too isolated.
