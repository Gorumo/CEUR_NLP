The main Idea is to balance activities troughout the area, bringing a sinergy between them. Also, i located office areas close to mixed use and commercial areas. This should make the transportation easier. I located 3 cultural attractions close to the shore, at strategic points so we have two close to other  developed neighborhoods and the main one altogether with the city park. office towers are integrated to the roads so we can avoid havy traffic inside this area too. And most important, i planned almost the whole coast with park areas, so it is accessible for all citizens. also a continuos paved space along the right side to make a conection between 2 cultural attractions to make a link with activities on the weekends or for weekdays exercises and recreation time
