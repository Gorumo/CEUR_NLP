I've group the building together by similar heights and volumes in order to maximize spatial efficiency. The longer, taller buildings are positioned along the outer edges towards the busier streets to increase safety and noise reduction. There are two controlled points of entry along these streets for safety concerns and flow of traffic as well. The remaining buildings are oriented in such a way to create smaller 'pocket' areas for greenery, gardening, communal gathering, etc. While still maintaining main corridors of communal traffic, and to reduce creating small passageways that could be a concern for safety and monitoring. These clusters of buildings will also hope to maximize passive ventilation systems as well.
