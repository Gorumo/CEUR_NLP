In order to make the space more livable, social buildings have been developed and also individual housing. In any case, each unit has a view to at least one open space, so the direct and natural light hours are increased. Also both types of housing share a central open space in order to integrate the community and they share a service area (distributed as a comb structure, on the left). The main idea is to porfit the natural resources and to work and live as an integrated community.
