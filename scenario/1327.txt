The idea behind this proposal, is to create a shared large 'backyard' and several smaller 'frontyards' which are facing the street. These smaller frontyards are shared with direct neighbors and offer a bit more privacy and sense of belonging. The backyard could become a large space for meeting. For instance you could put a small field of solar panels and a playground for children in the center. Everyone profiting from this should do small stuff in return, like keeping the area clean. It's kind of a positive panopticon-idea in which neighbors live together.
