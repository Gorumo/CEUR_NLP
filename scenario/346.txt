The main idea was based on creating smaller communities, in order to manage the resulting small public spaces in a better way, parking lots and green areas and also pedestrian or mechanic flows are going to be organized by inhabitants of each cluster. Some higher buildings were placed purposely amidst the site to lead sights along alleyways and from certain points they create eye-barriers either for inner and outer points of view.
