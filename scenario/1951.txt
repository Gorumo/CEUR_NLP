In this design I've used all types of buildings. Area is divided to sections, with lots of greenary linking them. New area going to attract a lot of people (residents, tourists) and walking spaces, pathes should be circumspect. Accessibility to seashore is also in priority. Business buildings are located near to road, commercial buildings have entertainment goals, and likely would become popular place to visit, mainly because of their location. Residential buildings are placed to have nearly equable view from thier apartments. Also, tradintional style buildings are "must-have" in this area. They create historical spirit, and is very interesting to walk by them. Despite of high density in the city, this area should not become just allocation space full of "ant hills". 
Thank you for your attention!)
