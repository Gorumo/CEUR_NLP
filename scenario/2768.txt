I believe the best solution would be to keep the waterfront as green as natural as possible, while keeping the highest building on the other side in order to protect all the area from the road. Except from a connection with the green existing park where it would be extremely important to look for a connection. The cultural attraction are surrounded by paved open spaces and the green areas while the offices, together with the mied use and commercial building are sourrounded by neighbourhood parks.
