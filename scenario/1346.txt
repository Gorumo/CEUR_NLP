I maintained the existing guidelines of the environment where the project is located, so as to achieve a formal dialogue and generate spaces for future green areas, both for public use and for the private use of the inhabitants. The houses are located in the perimeter of the block, so as to have a quick access to the street, leaving areas of integration with the immediate pedestrian environment in some sectors. Due to the small size of the houses, it is considered of great importance to integrate them into free spaces where people can "extend" their activities, without losing their privacy.

I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this course and I hope constructive criticism of my proposal.
