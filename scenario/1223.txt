TWO SQUARES: at first though the extensive area of Ikwezi Park is needed of new public spaces. The proposal organizes the small neighborhood around two squares of different dimensions. The biggest one is opened to the Intlanganiso Secondary School, creating an Agora which can be used by the students, street markets and for the public in general. The secondary square is open to the south, and has a more privately character. A way to improve the accessibility of the area is to resolve the intersection between the two axis (Njong Avenue and Miambo Street), we can do this by conforming the residential buildings in parallel to those streets. Adding two perpendicular lines of houses we create the two squares.
