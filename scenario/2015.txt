For reconstruction of the Greater Southern Waterfront area in Singapore we were given three types of housing, greens spaces, commercial and business areas. 

Land is a scarce and valuable resource, thus determining dense development. A mix of high-, mid-  and low-rise building create more aesthetically appealing cityscape.

This proposal focuses on grouping / clustering estate based on functionality and housing type (hight and price of the building).

There are two business areas, clusters of luxurious estate by the coastline; commercial areas, including Chinatown located in a dense residential area, that also serves as a commercial space.

Due to high humidity and warm temperatures the main function of green spaces is to make the area liveable, provide vents between buildings. Green areas and “corridors” between housign allow for breathability. 

Real estate build on the coastline instantly raises the price of real estate no matter the type of building. Hence luxurious real estate build by private sector is more likely to being build there.
