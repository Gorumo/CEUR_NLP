The design concept simply integrates all urban aspects of connectivity, visibility, centrality and accessibility as much as possible.
Instead of formal grids, rigid linearity, or other top-down geometries, I tried to allow the alignment to respond to the site's geometry. The design is done as explained below:
1. Connectivity: group of buildings are connected together in a loop that forms a courtyard. This inner courtyard can be personalized for the sharing neighbors for hanging laundry, visit gatherings, parties, etc. A green landscape within can offer views from the back elevations. In addition, extension from the back of each house is possible for a few meters.
2. Accessibility: the site is bordered by two main streets and two settlement areas. The design creates main axes that allow the inhabitants and crossers-by to easily access the site. Secondary paths cross between building blocks into a main inner courtyard of a group of buildings.
3. Centrality: Besides the smaller central courtyards, a central area in the middle of the site is created for communal purposes; gatherings, playgrounds, cultural events, etc.
4. Visibility: The visible axes that cut through the main site gives a welcoming sense that it is easily accessible and permitted of entry by any one, so not to make it closed and like a prison. The central courtyard is a visible spot in the middle that serves as a landmark and central space. In addition, each house has a few meters in the front of the building along the main street/pathways that serves as a visible personal space to personalize and individualize.
