In general:
All parking is underground or as in the high rises, on the lower layers of the building. This way there is space to walk, cycle and play outside in all safety.

I have a mixture of office, commercial, residential and nature.
The latter serves a dual purpose: the first is to ensure there is recreational space close to home and work, the second is to ensure good storm water management as having large areas of green will allow rainwater to be absorbed in the ground and not flood the streets.
