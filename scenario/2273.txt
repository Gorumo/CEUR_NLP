Open space in the form of a river or green corridor to all residential. Fair mix of low-rise, social and high density private. Private condos, social housing and low rise shops and houses are mixed to reduce isolation and improve local place making. Commercial and business districts are connected to transport hubs, have less need for greenery as they are more for attracting a further traveller for a specific purpose so are unlikely to need variety. Still in close proximity to low-rise house shops so area identities can be developed and attract people from inside and outside the waterfront area.
