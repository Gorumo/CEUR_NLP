In my proposal I tried to open up the area for better orientation, clear navigation and that way to enhance the feeling of safety. I tried to use existing connections and work with the connections from surroundings to open up those areas as well. There are two main streets and the rest is more pedestrian alleys (hard to define in the simple software). I placed the larger buildings to crossings for better navigation, and possible services (shops...) facing the main street. By multiple connections with the main street and towards the school I was hoping to slow traffic in that segment of the street. The central space is a small square for playground and meeting area. I placed the houses quite loosely for their owners to have the possibility to add to them and grow their homes.
