3d geometry is oriented to the sides of the world
In order to cover the neighboring houses from the sun (you need a verification calculation in Autodesk Ecotect and Grasshopper to calculate the optimal location)
The temperature differences on the sunny and shaded facades create a natural draft for ventilation.
The arrangement of geometry forms 2 pedestrian passes through a residential area
Also, local public areas have been formed
And common courtyards
