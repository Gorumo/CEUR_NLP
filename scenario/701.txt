The houses are organised around 3 main streets to provide easy access to transport means. There is enough distance left between the houses so that solar batteries installed on the roofs will not be in the shade from the nearby buildings. The houses are organised in such a way that the windows will face the streets even if some of the buildings are in the second row. There is a "Villas" zone for more affluent citizens and  families with children - in the centre of this zone there is some empty space for recreation facilities. The "square" is left free for social events such as celebrations, town feasts, etc. The infrastructure, such as shops, clinics, schools, gyms and nursery schools can be added in locations near main residence buildings. Thus, the district has a clear panning, easy transport access and enough space for recreation.
