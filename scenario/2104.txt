The design ideas are: 
- move the 4 m high houses on the south side in blocks of 5 houses
- addensate the 2.5 m houses in sticks of 3-5 houses and position them on the north and east side
- create easy accessibility to the inner court 
- the inner court will be a semi-public space, so people can use it both for working and kids for playing
