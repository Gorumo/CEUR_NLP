1)	There are two main roads adjacent BT-Section, one towards the right and one below, ample space for entrance into building has been provided access these main roads. The main/primary entrance is in right side in my design, where as the one below is secondary entrance.
2)	The bottom right corner of the block (8 units) separated from rest of the houses and is strategically located to have access to both primary as well as secondary entrance. The purpose of this block is as below
a.	 Recycling of waste water and bio solids 
b.	Power backup/generator
-	All roof tops of BT-Section houses will have solar panel
c.	Rainwater Storage Tanks and treatment 
-	All roof tops of BT-Section houses will serve as catchment area for rain water
d.	Vehicle Parking 
3)	In the design high rise building are towards the center so that more ventilation is available for low rise houses which are located in the edges.			
4)	  More space has been provided in and around high rises since more number of people would be staying in these houses/buildings. 
5)	Enough space has been provided between the boundary and the house for the ventilation and enough light and also plants can be planted around the boundary to get fresh air. Wide space between the building and near to right gate wanted to have an Acupressure Garden.
