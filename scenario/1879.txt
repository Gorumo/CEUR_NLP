I propose  a concept, which considers to devide a living (intimate) zone and activ zone. The living area is at eastern and active zone is at western. Residential buildings are on the northern and southern sides separated with a "green ave". In between north and south residentions sugested a playground for children, surrounded by a little forrest. Walking along the Ave in between the living area you reach an active zone. It suposed to have some markets, places to relax, some eating places.
