The area has two entrances (left and right). There are several open areas in between the shacks that provide for community spaces, such as gardens, outdoor dining areas, etc. Shacks are lined up around the perimeter to provide for a sound barrier towards the big street. There is sufficient space in between the shacks for transportation and logistics. Unfortunately sun direct and other micro climate factors not known yet to evaluate the layout in that sense.
