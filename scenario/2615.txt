As I also live in tropical country, I tried to imagine how I'd like to live in this place if it was in Brazil. 
My idea was to take advantage of what the nature can offer. Thus, I chose to place a linear park along the coast, creating a great natural environment with the mix of green and water. Also, the green park can be kind of a barrier to prevent the water to advance towards the buildings. In addition, not only people who work or live in the region, but all inhabitants of the city who desire, can benefit from the views and the good environment along the park and the sea coast.
The middle of the area is also a park without buildings to offer any barrier for people coming from the roads to access the linear park and sea.
Tall buildings were place in the back and smaller ones in the front, thus, all of them can benefit from the view. I chose to place residential buildings on the right side of the land due to the proximity of the existent residential area (Cantonment) and I placed some mixed use, commercial and one cultural building nearby to serve people who will live here.
On the left side, I put offices and high density mixed use buildings due to the proximity with VivoCity (shopping), thus it works as a continuation of a commercial area.
To keep the views opened to the sea from the roads, I didn't densify the area a lot and all buildings are connected by a neighbourhood park. The distance between the buildings is also good for natural ventilation and lighting.
I also didn't put any theme park, cause there is one nearby in Sentosa, so I thought one more is not necessary here.
