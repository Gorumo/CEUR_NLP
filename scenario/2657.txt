The main idea is the creation of polifunctional cluster around a city park - residential, mixed, commercial, offices. City parks are connected through other neighborhood parks or park connectors. The main road to the city becomes a pedestrian paved open space that finishes on the city with a cultural center. Building height decreases depending on the distance from the sea (the closer, the shorter). the waterfront is designed with paved open areas, parks and cultural center, where people can admire the very element of water.
