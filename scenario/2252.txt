As it is inspired from the Duoxiang China, that I strongly believe that' natural design' in a taoist way: we display the necessities to 'simplify' our life, and as we sit there, on the ground of this area, we really do not to care so much about the outside world, only what we see here, with sunlight. Also, I have confidence that ' the less we change the original feature, the more we can feel inside'. I used here 'alcove' concept, and give the maximum possibility to people to 'enlarge their horizon themselves': What we design here is not so important, but the 'integration' of us into the 'Duoxiang world' which means not zen, but 'go forward' for a self-creation to learn to how to define yourself.
