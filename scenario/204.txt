One (perhaps unnecessary) constraint to this design was due to my inability to figure out how to rotate the buildings using my MacBook laptop. This didn't trouble me so much, as I think it helped to keep some of the organic aesthetic of the neighborhood. A key intention of the design was to create a shortcut through the neighborhood, picking up on the nearby roadways. I attempted to incorporate a series of courtyards. These spaces are intended to be a mix of public and private space. Although there are not any roadways in this design, clearly there are pathways to access the buildings.
