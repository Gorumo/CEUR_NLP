The main concept applied in this plan is the Positive Space.

Using Architecture and how it should be grouped, the idea is to create inner spaces, which creates these positive spaces.

This type of space enhances community life, allows numerous activities and social relationships, improves sunlight and urban ventilation.

The larger buildings line the street because of the possibility of housing trades in their ground floors, while the smaller ones are inside the court so that they can serve only as a dwelling.

On the other hand, the areas outside the positive spaces allow a greater permeability of the block, which values ​​urban mobility on the pedestrian scale and creates a complex network of connection between these positive spaces and the city.
