Non-symmetrical design (people typically don't like living in cookie cutter environments). Close walls to help insulate from weather and temp conditions, fire walls could be built between each structure using brick parapet design to prevent potential spread of fire. This design creates a community neighborhood overall as well as sub-communities with each individual building cluster. This maximizes space efficiencies by creating more recreational space as a whole for kids to play, adults to socialize and share meals together than you would have if each unit had a small plot of land. Depending on size you could even potentially erect small playsets for kids. I don't know the overall vision for use of land in this project but feel outdoor recreation space can dramatically change the experience for residents even if technically the land could be needed for housing. Maybe some compromise in the middle over time but the video suggested the vertical housing designs were hoping to free up land.
