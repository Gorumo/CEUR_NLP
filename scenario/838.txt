The intent of this design was mobility, with two main access points, and enough space between the back and mid buildings to provide space for a walk-path.

The middle of the plan - as the center of the community - is meant to serve as a sort of promenade, with the triangle space between the buildings to the right, offering space to serve as a park.

Naturally, the tallest buildings being street-side and in the back, allow for a downward view toward the communities below.
