The following row house model is designed for accessibility and connectivity as well as building density management. It is accessible because the paths are easy to drive in from the major streets. These major streets on the South side also connect them to public services and commercial buildings. Simultaneously, the public spaces between the communities allow for sports, play, and leisure activities and street parking. The buildings are also spaced within the grid so that walking or car access is not obstructed. While ordered, this model allows for a balance between public space for human interaction and convenient daily travel/ commute.
