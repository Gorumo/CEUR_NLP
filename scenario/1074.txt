The main driver in the design is to fostering interactions within dwellers. The disposition of buildings facing each others, creates open squares  to be used as common spaces, that communicate among themselves through passages and corridors. These corridors have multiple accesses from the perimeter roads. In particular the directions of these corridors are aimed towards the schools located on the northern side. From the inside of the complex, the corridors' perspective gives a sense of width and depth of the surrounding environment compared to the smothering current layout.
