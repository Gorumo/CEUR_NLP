The site has to leverage natural features & infrastructure around it. It has a huge water front that be developed along with low rise mixed development. This provides equal opportunity/ access (physical & visual) to all segments of people. Offices & commercial establishments are along the arterial roads for ease of shipment & visibility(of establishment). High-rise mixed development forms the next layer, beyond commercial development. The high-rise residential development is between mixed use developments which act as buffer zones too for the residential zone. City parks are used across site (as a central axis) to create a lung space & passive recreation space. Park connectors are used as a relief to built spaces & have connectivity between various spaces. Cultural centers are at strategic locations act as a point of accentuation or node & connect various functions. Theme park is created along the water front, away from development. I have visited Singapore which has limited land & the density on land would be high due to lack of land. High density zoned are segregated towards the periphery & medium density towards the water front to create a hierarchy.
