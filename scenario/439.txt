Here's my proposal in which I considered communication, visibility and recreation. How so? Well, on terms of communication, the city is well connected through the main paths that are also the dividers of each block and the borders of all the area available for the project. For visibility, because of the disposition of the block, it is posible for the users to have full visibility inside and outside the complex. Finally on recreation, because of the block disposition, it is posible to consider the inside area as great possibility for recreation and green areas development.
