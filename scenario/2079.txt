The ideas are (1) that all houses must be accessible via a road; therefore extra roads are created. (2) the higher buildings are grouped in two groups in the outer corners to give a more "ordered" look. (3) The - what I interpreted as - bigger houses are grouped in a triangle enclosing a shared space for private gardens. In this manner the area enables people of different wealth living together, and having "similar" neighbours.
