I admit, I am not quite sure what we are supposed to be doing and why this connects to responsive (other than allowing citizens to participate). I put the higher priced real estate in its own private space surrounded by greenspace.  HDB and shophouses were positioned in other spaces. Because I can't lay roads, I can't get a real good idea of what it will really look like. The program is neat, however.
