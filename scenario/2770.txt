Residential area alongside the sea. Parks between residential buildings. Mixed use alongside the road in the central area. High density mixed use places in the inner space - nearby cultural attractions and commercial places. Offices are on the right side close to cantonement. I tried to make residental place more environmental friendly while others are placed with more consideration on convenience in terms of traffic and other activities such as culture and shopping.
