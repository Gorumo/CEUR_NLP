an organic layout with interspersed courts for community gathering spaces ,identity markers at all the corners of the side, a strong edge with landmark high buildings that define this district. the shaded walkways provide a relief in the otherwise harsh weather conditions. the different sizes of courts act as hierarchical open spaces thereby acting as spaces for incidental interactions. There is an element of surprise provided at every nook and corner of the layout making it socially sustainable.
