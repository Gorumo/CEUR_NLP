The Greenbelt is kept alongside the waterfront for exploring the same to the fullest potential. The MIxed use development is placed at the rear periphery so that best view can be gained to the penthouses. The Amusement theme park is put up at the extreme end for the recreation purpose. There is a community center and a commercial block near the same for interdependence. Also, there is a separate hub created for both residential and commercial activity. The residential zone is accompanied by the city park and it is taken care that the commercial zone is at a walkable distance from the residential towers.
