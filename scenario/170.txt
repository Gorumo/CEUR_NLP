The concept used to arrange the shacks was “clustering”. This was based on the building areas, heights, and massing of the building blocks. Three (3) clusters were developed and grouped together based on the spaces they require. The middle portion is devoted for open space and amenities, which is then intersected by two (2) roads/paths. The longer on is considered as the main spine/access of the clusters. The clusters create open spaces that promote expansion for future development and circulation to natural light and ventilation within the development.
