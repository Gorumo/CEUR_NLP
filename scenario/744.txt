The design was created following 3 axis: 
1- creation of demarcated pathways and public spaces allowing access for basic services but also for emergency vehicles (connectivity and accessibility criteria),
2- grouping by blocks allowing a greater sense of community and somewhat allowing facilities, green and social areas and infrastructure management (centrality and accessibility criteria),
3- position the lower buildings facing the street (high-rise at the back), central public place for each block allowing visibility, better perspective and luminosity (visibility and centrality criteria).
