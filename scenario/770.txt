The general idea behind the design is to allow the quarter to self-adapt and self-develop. Considering the nature of these urban settings it is inevitable to prevent this process. Therefore, the design aims to simply boost development and create conditions for further evolution of the arrangements / environment. Spatial expression which aim to achieve this goal is the combination of using grid network with certain open spaces which would create the perception of in/out feelings and help accommodate communal activities. In addition, this aims to provide certain degree of coherence (easier orientation within the space) and complexity (irregularities and diversity of the space).
