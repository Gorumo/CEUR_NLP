I have tried to arrange the buildings in order for them not to distinguish from the surroundings. I think that we should try to gain experience from the local people and their habits to create a place that would be suitable for them. I have put the highest buildings close to the street in order to isolate the smaller ones from the cars, noise etc. There is a way to each house as well. Local people would be able to communicate and live together freely.
