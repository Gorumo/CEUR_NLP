Design for a new waterfront district with attractive housing areas. The new development on the former container terminal area is devided in subareas, each with distinct building structures and open space features. Important connetions of the new areas with the existing city center are beeing stressed either through office clusters or greenery.

Public green spaces are located at the waterfront (accessibility) and in every subarea to generate attractive outdoor spaces for leisure purposes and new nodes ofA neighbourhoor activities. The design intends to ensure good microclimatic condition (avoid heat island effects, high thermal comfort).

The types of housing, densities and building height are different in each subarea. The design is meant to built up new communities with a smal- scale mixture of social, traditional and privat sector housing in order to create a diversity of the buildt environment and to provide a new neighbourhood for different citizens thus making the subareas more resilient in the longterm.
