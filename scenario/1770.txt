The idea was:
-To provide direct access of roads to the community.

-To Provide visual connection between green spaces of 3 different cluster & thus enhancing co-presence along with co-awareness in the community. 

-To Give private space at backyard of the each residences...jointly perceived as a continuous green patch in the community for various recreational purposes.

-In front of the buildings 4 to 5 meter space is kept for pedestrian walkway and cycle tracks.

-The building orientation is done such a way that the longer axis is in E-W orientation...to maximise north south ventilation.

-staggered back row  is for enhancing airflow into the back houses.

-The building with height 4 is kept at the rare side to give visual preference to the 2.5 height...so that it do not gets visually blocked by 4 height.
