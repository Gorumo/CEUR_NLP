Now as we can see we can provide much more vehicular space in the residential area and the commercialised part also have better connectivity with Njongo Ave and the school building as through lanes can be built. Thus, giving good accessibility to the school from the houses. Also, more parking spots can also be provided in the periphery and encouragement to people to park on those spots can also be given. Smart assistive lights with parking spot availability sensors can also be provided for quick movement and efficient use of fuel and energy. 
Public transit system can also be provided on Njongo Ave and the pedestrian crossing with safe crossing sensors for handicap people can also be provided on the same for safe, comfortable and smooth movement of people and vehicles.
