The goal of this planning is to create a mix-use and friendly environment for citizens. I broke the traditional idea of zoning and tried to mix different types of buildings and functions together to create connections and encouragement for civil life. Mixing commercial and traditional Chinatown and Tiong Bahru hopefully will bring back the energetic street life we used to have in traditional cities. However, to increase the efficiency of land use, high rises are still suggested in this proposal. But in order to make them more friendly and inclusive, high rises are connected by greenery and low rise commercial streets.
