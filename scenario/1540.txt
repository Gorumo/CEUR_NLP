This proposal features most houses along the main road for easy access, whilst leaving space behind the houses for small patches for urban farming, where families can grow their own fruits and vegetables.

There is also an entry point into a wider open communal space which can be used to house a market, and a few public buildings for entertainment purposes to foster a close sense of community are also located there, such as a community center, including on-site sanitary facilities. An administrative building and possibly school are located on the opposite side of the main road for improved access and safety.

The buildings themselves are mostly one story traditional houses, using local building materials. Slightly taller two-story buildings surround the open market area for extra space (I couldn't figure out how to make them taller in the tool). The open area apart from garden patches should also include plenty of trees, and vegetation between the houses themselves will also help keep heat away during hot times.
