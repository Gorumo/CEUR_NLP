Old And New Singapore: Strong mixed living focus. General lower rise/green focus by water edge - except for model new condominium. Concentrate greater apartment living near office tower hub and MRT. Bias more towards new style HDB rather than old because of profile of location. Concerntrations of Chinatown options to balance bulk.
