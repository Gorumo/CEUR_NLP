My idea for this exercise is to create a rectangular street structure allowing easy access as any building on the site.
I placed most tall buildings in the middle in order to allow shorter buildings to benefit from natural light for as much time as possible.
Also I designed some small squares which I think are suitable for organising various activities such as street commerce or pleygrounds for children. At the same these squares can be used as loisir spaces with vegetation.
In the interior part of the urban island I arranged a lane bordered by buildings that allow easy access into the interior of the site.
