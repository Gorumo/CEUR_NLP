The main idea came from the surrounding axes that were created by people who use this area to live, communicate and socialize. 
The school buildings on the other side of the road define the main axis that separate the area studied into two parts because a huge social central public space will be too big for this kind of residential complexes.
I believe, in this case, people need to contact with each other in a socially appropriate scale space. 
The middle axis provides a visual and actual axis between the front and the back streets, that will bring more social move into the area and increase the interactive relationships between neighbors. In the center of the bigger public space, we can find three units that can be a landscape function that gives more active life to the complex.
