The main two criteria I mainly followed are 1. visibility (security perception) and 2. accessibility (continuity of the current access routes to the surroundings plots & good connection with the existing road network). To comply with visibility criterion I have left many open spaces between buildings instead of aggregating them in building blocks (like the ones we have in dense western cities). I've also avoided narrow streets. The street pattern of a township is not the same as in other European / US cities adapted to the cars, that is why I didn't consider very important to follow a regular grid. I've chosen a more "natural" pattern and I've tried to imitate the surroundings blocks structure in order not to disrupt the landscape. Regarding the other 2 criteria: 3. centrality and 4. connectivity  I would say that nothing is central and is sort of equally distributed, which I don't consider as a bad thing. I think connectivity is the weakest criteria in this design, it's true that every house /block is well connected to the main road network, however, I am lacking experience to ponder my design regarding connectivity.
