A modern green district with a lot of walking areas, pedestrian embankments, a dense network of green streets and boulevards and a convenient location of business and commercial development near transport hubs.
A balance between a building density and open spaces affords to develop this area with the maximum cost-effectiveness.
- All embankments are open walking spaces / parks.
- The first line of buildins after the shoreline is luxurius housing because of the most expensive land here.
- The height of buildins in the east and in the south rises from the lowest next to the embankment to highrise houses in the center to provide a good view of the district and decent visibility.
- Shopping malls and business centers are situated near metro stations to provide the best transport access.
