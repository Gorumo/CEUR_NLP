A green corridor was used to connect parks and housing blocks all along the bay, penetrating the blocks strategically to permit every housing block to have direct access to a green connecting strip, whilst at the same time creating smaller more manageable "neighborhoods". The housing blocks were chosen so that there would be integration between private and public, but were localized so that taller blocks would be in the back, and shorter ones closer to the green corridor and bay. This allowed favorable bay-views to be maximized, whilst at the same time taking advantage of the taller blocks to mitigate the effect of roads, and business/commercial areas from affecting the housing areas.
