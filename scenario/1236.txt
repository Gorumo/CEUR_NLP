I have tried to create as many as common spaces as possible that can be use for green areas, urban gardens, community activities, etc. Also, I have tried to orient the buildings NorhtEast so they can get the sunlight during the main hours of the day. Last I tried was to create a false feeling of streets in between lines of buildings, to ease transit among them.
