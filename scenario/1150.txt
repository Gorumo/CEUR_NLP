The idea is to create a big square in front of the secondary school with gardens and playgrounds, where the youths can socialize. You can access to the square from the 3 main streets.
The other houses create 3 private patios for people who lives in.
Share and socialize is a big value for a poor society and they can recognize their identity in these spaces, often the only thing they may have.
