Mesh new townscape with old. Expand the existing street network. ‘Gather’ surrounding homes into the new development (share its positive influence).
Reinforce the street frontages, assume ‘stoop’ style socialising.
Through routes across site tangential to courtyard spaces, encourage pausing at the centre, focus movement along the edges.
Ensure visibility and observation of the public spaces from within the homes while spacing houses to ensure internal privacy.
Use functional back yards to separate housing rows. Agglomerate central common area for community use; gathering or gardening.
Maximise northern exposure for winter sun ingress, passive warming. Make permeable to summer breezes from the south east.
