Key Features of the redesign:
1. Centrality - Focal point of the redesign is the "community centre", the largest structure located at the center of the block, where various community activities can take place (co-operatives, functions, etc.)
2. Accessibility/Connectivity - Four main pedestrian access points to the block have been created which all convene at the community centre and provides connectivity to the surrounding schools and communities.  Most structures have direct access to the roads.
3. Density/Distribution - Structures have been spread out to the periphery of the block with creation of four semi enclosed zones, each with their own open spaces. Taller structures dominate the western zones while the lower structures are located in the eastern zones.
4. Visibility - Each structure is ensured of a view of public open space. The pedestrian walkways create clear sight lines to the community centre.
