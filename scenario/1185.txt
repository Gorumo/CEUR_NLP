The building should be located in a rather open set-up which includes moving the buildings closer together but leaving enough space for accessabilty. Also easy access from building to streets are as important as easy access to pblic buildings like Kindergartne or school if established. THere shoudl be enough space for green and leasure areas as well. Ideally the living area will be connected to a public transportation system. The easier might me to Ã¼rovide bus stations at main streets.
