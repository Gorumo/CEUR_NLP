I did not find the orientation , so I organised the layout with spatial considerations only.
I preserved continuation of the T ending road and of paths to parcels at the immediate surroundings in order to improve connectivity, accessibility and vistas.  These vista are also beneficial with a CPTED  (Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design) point of view. I created 3 access "streets".
I put most buildings in row houses so as to gain space for public and semi-public space, creating a "common ground" at the center of the neighbourhood, as well as inner sub-communities.

Highest buildings on fa√ßade of the road (espacially at the crossroad) for 2 reasons :
- to maximize endogenous economic development potential
- to protect neighborhood inside from road noise

The design allows for front and back usage
