Analyzing the area it can be seen that the quality of the constructions are low. As for the layout, it shows that it wasn’t planned, it grew up organically. What it usually associated with that type of settlement is the feeling of not belonging, and not having the right to their own quality space in the city.
In my sketch, I propose a different concept from the surrounding. The idea is to build the block of houses on the boders building the overall configuration of the closed block. But, also leaving the center to an open and common space. What this sketch seeks, is to not repeat the context design here, but do something different so this area could pop up in the neighborhood context, so that those who live here would be proud to live in a different type of place, but now, this “different” is the result of a new connotation.
Being more specific, the center of the block is destined to be a square, where children can meet their friends, while their mother even at house, are able to see their kids through the windows, and be certain that they are safe. This are could also be used, by grownups to make parties and gatherings. So, instead of having houses with small distances between each other, I propose to arrange them is a such way that you can have housing and recreation in really close spaces.
