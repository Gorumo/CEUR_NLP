It is noticed that the residences of this block did not contain spaces for social conviavility. Because of this the project had as principle to implement these spaces.
In this project was implemented a central plaza for citizens, as well as a square on the west side that invites people from the neighborhood to join this place. Therefore, as can be observed, the residences do not contain private gardens, encouraging social coexistence in the projected squares.
It was also implemented a boardwalk, which invites people from the neighborhood to join this place, bringing ambience and life to this locality.
In addition the houses were designed to receive the prevailing winds of the ESE direction. It was also left a retreat from the streets, with a proposal to widen the sidewalks for future pedestrian walks.
