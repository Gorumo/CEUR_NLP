This project is designed based on the idea of community gardens forming three clusters. The gardens are represented by the white space. High density and commercial buildings are located facing the main road. Single dwellings are located on the inner side of the lot. There is also a green way that connects the main road with the clusters and with the walkway of the neighbourhood next to it (west side).
