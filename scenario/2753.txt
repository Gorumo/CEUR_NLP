I'd like the shore to be open and public. Also, I put in some offices so there's movement during working hours, and the people might be able to work close to where they live. I put Cultural places surrounded by connected green areas, so it becomes an appealing and fun environment for everyone in the city, who would go to events happening in different areas of the intervention, and the residents could walk there, using the connectec parks. The offices are close to comercial areas, where they can eat, and/or run errands, and the people and tourists who are just enjoying the place can shop and eat. The idea is that there are restaurants and other comercial places that stay open until late, and it's safe to walk around at anytime. Workers can also enjoy the shore while on break, and its possible to walk all of its extension o bike. Close to the water the density is low, so high density resdents can look at the view and people in the parks don't feel surrounded by too many buildings.
