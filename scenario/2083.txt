Mixed, no segregation community:

My design stressed three aspects 

1- My design intentionally focused on mixing 4-floor and 2-floor units, I'm assuming that the 4-floor units contain multiple residential apartments which might be occupied by residents who might have less income than the individual 2-floor units, therefore mixing both units gives the feel of equality rather than segregation.

2- The proposed design carefully considered the creation of shared public spaces to encourage community activity.

3- Access to the community from major streets
