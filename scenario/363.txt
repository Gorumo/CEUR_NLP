Social relationships through urban space.
The main aim is to create a small urban framework defined by spatial, typological and mobility diversity that allows the integration of people with their environment and improve livability.

1. Urban spaces such as: Points of Access, semi-public and public spaces, can promote activities and paths around the built environment, they also allow to different community groups that they can come together in these spaces to share and exchange ideas, as if it were smart spaces. 

2. The organization of different building types, defines the urban profile, and referent points, that help to display and to identify the inhabitants with their environment. Keeping density on the edge along the main street, and inside, typologies with lower occupation.

3. An interior circulation path gives more flexible connections between different public spaces inside the plot and also allows better accessibility
