My idea was to create a pleasently relaxed community. On the outside border, the area is protected from noise and pollution by the taller buildings, which have open vistas. Then come the rows of smaller houses, with gardens and patios, facing the common green space where they can watch their children play. Finnally, the core of the community is a large green space, to be landscaped as a tree lined garden with water features, as well as a playground. Neighbours can seat under a tree on a bench and talk and relax. The access between the houses are pedestrian pathways and cycleways only. Access for cars and parking will be on the outside border, to create a tranquil pollution free space for all.
