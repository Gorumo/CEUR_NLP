Unfortunately, this tool is really very hard to use – at least on my computer. But my original aim would have been to bring the buildings into an order which allows to open up space for the inhabitants to move more freely and also gather for neighbourhood events.
As a side effect I wanted to achieve to make now dark corners – which might be a problem at night – a bit brighter and easier to oversee. By giving each house a second floor and with then less buildings having more empty space to play with it might be possible also to let wind blow through the place and cool it down naturally.
Additionally, a more geometrically clean layout might help to better plan and realise sanitation and an electricity grid, as well as access to the streets.
