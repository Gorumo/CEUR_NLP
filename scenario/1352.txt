The idea of the project is to open the block with local low-speed roads and wide sidewalks for leisure and leisure activities. With shorter blocks it is possible to increase the possibilities of percussion, making the urban mesh more permeable. It was maintained a distance of the route of greater speed allowing a greater security, and reduced the scale of the users. The buildings were placed with their major facades oriented in the north-south position considering the region's climate.
