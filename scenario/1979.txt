Here are the notions I have tried to address in my proposal:
1. Create a street network - complementing the existing urban grid - flanked by interconnected green corridors.
2. Pay attention to the height clusters - decreasing towards the waterfront edge.
3. Give priority to the social housing type - easier regulated in terms of price, and contributing to social equality. 
4. Group the luxurious type of buildings around the office area - employees are likely to take residence in these.
5. Form residential blocks homogeneous in density, and linked through sky-bridges and overground social spaces.
6. Provide all the blocks with equally easy access to the commercial.
7. Organize a waterfront park for all the residents, and visitors from other parts of the city.
