My proposal suggests that the houses be organised around a series of internal streets. This allows the neighbourhood to continue to be part of the urban fabric, without closing itself in on itself. The different typologies are mixed, and therefore not put into different categories, allowing the different sizes of families to be amongst each other. Inside the lot, two small spaces are created that can be used by the inhabitants for more social purposes.
