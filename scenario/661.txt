The centre in the middle shall represent centrality and oneness of the quarter, which has a public park in the middle.  The four small diagonally placed buildings are living labs. Along the main road we find office space, co-working, a school and a university branch for informatics. In the western part we have a supermarket, doctors office, day clinic etc. Other developments are residential.
