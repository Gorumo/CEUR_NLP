The idea is to keep the pattern of settlement simplistic, yet efficient for future retrofitting. The projected model is derived with a concept of neighborhood planning aiming to provide a physical infrastructure and spaces which can improve the human interaction with each other and with surrounding vicinity.  the settlement is planned in such a way that it become less dense and more open as one move from east to west, creating a sense of openness. The aim is to keep the east side less prone to change. In the same way, the settlement along north side road facing the school are planned to leave less room for change in design and skyline. The reason behind it to give a strong identity to this face with minimal room for change and to keep the sense of belonging, once developed, for a longer period and to create a synergic design with the design of the primary and secondary school. East side of the site is dedicated to commercial and day-time activities, whereas the west side is to residential and full day activities. A community center, planned between these two zones, could work as a connector between two zones.
The openness in design pattern towards south side is to showcase the openness towards surrounding neighborhood. It is like to welcome them in. The free zone at the south-west side is for future expansion of the neighborhood. The spaces which are surrounded by the residential units could be transformed into public parks,  gardens, and other social interaction points, aiming to create social harmony and a sense of belonging.
