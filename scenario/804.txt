Much of my thinking here is derived from the video provided in the assignment instructions. I was concerned about fire risk, hence providing clear access for emergency services and potential fire-break areas. More clear lines of sight/access will also make providing utilities (telephone, water, electricity, sewage) easier. Placing the higher buildings in the centre means they are not blocking light/breezes as much as they would be if situated to the edge. Many housing blocks have been co-located on single concrete slabs to reduce building costs. I have also attempted to keep as much open space as possible (for livestock, gardens, socialising) and have included a central piazza/square. This struck me as particularly important given the role of community leaders and community organisation in this project.
