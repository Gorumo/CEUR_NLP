This area is almost completely residential with uneven lots without public spaces for fun or moments to enjoy the neighborhood.
Smart cities are developed with high quality of life, making easier to live in it. So, I think this particular area needs:
1) be mixed, turn some residential places into commercial area, eventually helping mobility, because not concentrate just one kind of building in location.
2) Correct division of lot, structured.
3) Creat the common space.
4) Fixation of public cameras in the neighborhood for makes data to translate in informacion and help the community.
