the new part of the city should follow the cities existing structure. it should grow in size and height towards the north-east. The area should also have sufficient airflow, thats why the river front should be porous and low. the land prices are high so where its possible it should be densely built, but keeping in mind the heat and the humidity of the climate, the city needs lots of green parts.
