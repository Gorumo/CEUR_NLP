Design aim: Optimum space utilization along with ample public spaces and good roads connectivity.

I grouped most houses into blocks of 2-3 or 4 buildings to create extended facades which face north and south to minimize morning and afternoon sun heating impact.

To increase natural cross ventilation in the houses I put buildings in a way that their longest facades face the dominating wind (SE & ESE or W & N-W), keeping in mind that houses main doors and windows should locate on the windward sides.

Njongo Ave is considered as busiest road (because of the two schools). Angular location of the houses on this road provides their protection from extra road noise and dust.

Those buildings which face roads have trees & bushes as “protection screen” between them and road.

The high of the buildings is arranged the way to insure comfortable shading as well as eye-pleasing “sky-line”. 

On the S-E part of the plot there is a free space (space A) which has high level of visibility from the main roads, as well as convenient connection with all planned houses. It can be dedicated to the public car parking. As there is no information about number of the cars used by locals, car parking space can be reduced or replaced by Public Park / Sport area. 

On the N-W part of the plot there is free space as well (space B), which can be dedicated to the cultural space or a park. It lays in the short distance to the Intlanganiso Secondary School and can be used by it for some open to public activities.

There are two S-N inner roads which provide convenient accessibility to the Space B and Secondary School. At the same time, three W-E roads connect all habitants to the Space A and Nolungile Primary (kindergarten).

Space for the private courtyard is provided on the roof of the houses to save space on the ground and the green roof can provide houses with additional insulation.
