The high buildings are located at the back of the lot, providing a frame for the settlement. Lower buildings are located single and in groups in the middle. There is enough space between the buildings to minimize shadowing from surrounding buildings.  The settlement can be entered from the street between the buildings from both sides, although there is larger gap between buildings on the right side (sry, orientation unclear) serving as a main entrance.
