Couple of factors to take into consideration:
1. Prevailing winds - north westerly in winter and south easterly in summer (this area is a fairly flat landscape)
2. Security is important with all the crime and socio-economic issues in South Africa.
3. Sense of community 
4. Access
What is not known is the layout and design of the structures. Are they fixed or can the design be changed to accommodate any orientation? Assumption is yes - it can accommodate and orientation.
Design hopefully addresses the different factors:
(a) Bigger structures on the outside to provide some protection against winds as well as security.
(b) House access are all inwards and not onto the main roads for safety and security.
(c) 2 Main access roads in case of emergency - these areas are prone to fires especially in winter time. All structures are easy to reach in case of emergency.
(d) Open space in the middle - for community activities and option for gardening. Lot of these communities provide for themselves and/or others.
