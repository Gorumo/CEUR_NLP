I want to structure a plan and give for mast of houses an access to several courtyards because everyone wants to give an ability to playing in a car free, green zone for their children. Also I rotate buildings to direct the corner of the building to the North and South and windows  to the N-E, N-W,S-E, S-W to   reduce heat access wherein increase access of light. Also this position gives better entrance to a school and a hospital, which are around this territory.
