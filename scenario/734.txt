The main concept of this scheme is to develop public inclusive courtyards with different levels of public gathering elements progressing towards the largest community area (Central Greens) in the middle. The central green is then surrounded by smaller public spaces (courtyards) providing its users with semi-public and more intimate areas for social interaction. The court yards provide a better fit for human scale. The entire development could be walked by foot through a corridor that people could run / jog / walk without any obstructions, this area, is found at the perimeter of the development, further fostering movement from one courtyard to the other.
