The concept is to make a porous residential area inside the already existing urban fabric. 
The square, at the intersection of city streets, fosters social interactions between not only the inhabitants but also the people from the same district, and distributes streets that give access to apartments.
The streets are visible from outside the site perimeter and therefore open up to the city itself.
