So this is my proposal for the new version of the (previously) container terminal. All the buildings will be of course, made of sustainable materials, according to the needs of each place.
The border close to Cantonment districts has a line of residential buildings close to it, arranged in such a way that none of them obstructs the other's view. All residential buildings (despite their location) will be located close to commercial buildings, parks , and open spaces.
I decided it would be best to have a line of high-range buildings close to the Mt Faber park border. This lets them take advantage of the greenery of the parks and also ensures that all the buildings have access to the fresh sea breeze. Parks, paved areas and water elements across the terminal ensure that citizens have lots of open spaces for recreation purposes. 
The Vivocity border has a theme park, a couple of commercial buildings, a cultural attraction and lots  of open space to continue the mall ambience. 
Now for the seaside. I have avoided placing residential buildings on the coast to prevent flooding and other dangers (think cyclones!). So we have a line of parks and a cultural attraction there. Also some space is left blank. That's where the beach is. I think it's very important to have that. Surfing, anyone? :)
