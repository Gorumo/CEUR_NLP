There are 3 main passages leading to the central open area. 
The houses are in mixed clusters ( each cluster having at least one of the taller buildings), 
The clusters should help  people to assimilate more. Each cluster has it's own open space which inturn opens out to the main central clearing.
The open spaces can be used creatively by the community, as per their requirements. It can be playgrounds, cultural performance areas, meeting or gathering places in the evenings  or just landscaped areas with trees.
