Highlights of the design are
- two activity strips running perpendicular with dwellings on both sides
- activity strips intersecting at right angles at an entrance location
- large open green space inside precinct
- high density (tall) structures located nearer to activity strips
- low density (well spaced) structures facing roads, opportunities to increase visual amenity
- a shared private space in corner of precinct making use of unusual block shape
