The project aims at the construction of a group of collective villages, which are interconnected. It's main characteristics are:
- less visual pollution than a sequence of buildings or mini-blocks composed of houses;
- better control of the flow of residents and visitors; 
- guarantee greater tranquility for the residents, since the houses turn not to the street, but to the interior of the own village (this also stimulates the conviviality among the residents); 
- the tallest buildings are located inside the block, so they can not obscure the view of anyone who transits the street;
- finally, there is also the allocation of part of the block for the construction of a collective area such as a park, sports courts and entertainment activities for young people and children.
