The main idea of this layout is to arrange the buildings in a way that makes possible to orient living areas of each dwelling to match favorable orientation. NS and WE axes are used for this arrangement. Higher units are blocked along the Njongo Ave. which will form a noise reducing barrier. Existing dead end is extended into a driveway connecting Vukani and Mlambo streets. Lines of houses are separated with a distance that gives not only a possibility for dual side access to each house but also solves the issue of fire spreading treat that supposed to be one of the serious worries of settlers.
