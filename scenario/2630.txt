hi;
my plan is aimed to be a fully sustainable development
" What defines the character of a city is its public space, not its private space.Dr. Joan Clos, Executive Director, UN Habitat "
my idea is to create a space where ther are ralation between the privat and the public space.
i made three partial space so:
in the west side , i have a mixture of office, commercial, residential, paved and nature.
so the latter serves a dual purpose: one is to ensure there are paved and nature space close to work and home, and too is to make the work close to home
with the park connectore i connect the west and the midle space where i put : residential,paved open space, nature and cultural attraction spaces to the people who like a calme place  
to live 
finally in the Est partial i put the theme park, office, residential ( mixed use and high density mixed use) commercial, cultural attraction, city park and the commercial to the one who like stay close to nature home and work.
the important idea is to link a Public/private health to a sustainable space.
A healthy city is one in which citizens have access to basic infrastructure such as clean water, sanitation, and sewage treatment. It is also a place where healthy food is available to everyone,  where women and children can walk without fear, and where people can enjoy parks, squares, and other public or privat spaces in safety and comfort.
All the building will be smart buildings with clear energy systems and clear product.
