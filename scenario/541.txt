A big penetration space, connecting the block with the surrounding area, and providing light and ventilation in general. A block within a block to the right, cointaining the smaller units, and another one to the left, containing the rest. Taller units outside share the common, but more private (in opposition with the "penetration alley") public spaces with the ones on the inside "quarters". The alley also creates a connection with the adjacent block, that has a road - it could become an axis connection block, with conditions for the implementation of vehicle circulation, but also a green infrastructure to cool down the entire area.
A plaza and two taller units mark the entrance to that axis, giving some character to the block (reminds me of a Processional Way - "Processional Alley Block", and there you have a name for the complex).
