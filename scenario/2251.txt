I tried to connect existing green areas ( like existing park on the left of location) to the "new planed green areas like (green line on the wather front) with sequences of urban public places ( squares, urban planed garden , parks, greenery) so it can visually guide you to the watherfront. 
On the left side i noticed lack of buissnes spaces ( i asumed blue round buildings are more of buissnis centers) so major part of high density users is on the left. 
Middle part is conecting existing tissue in the background with visual separation, and then it goes ove into old part of "chinatown" with green areas and public spaces, wich slowly climbs into middle high residential buildings sorounded with greenery and wich still somehow alow you visual connectivity to the wather front. 
On the middle- right part it goes from buissnis to high to middle to lower rised buildings, wich aloves for some visual connectivity to waterfront for users ( sky views). 
On the right patr that has bigger green area it goes (from back) from high and high density, to middle and then small hight using some of thraditional elements to connect built tissue in the background and to alow at least visual conection and again all is tied with some urban and green spaces. 
I tried to use as much of height and space to ensure enough living spaces, and still to produce public livable areas, and visual and walking/driving connectivity to the main highway in the back of proposed building space.

*Also i didn't mowe existing blue and yellow buildings as from some proposals i was?t shure if we were aloved to. so i tried to adapt to the given situation on the map.
