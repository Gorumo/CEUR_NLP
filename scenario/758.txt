The main ideas behind this design are privacy, sound protection and enough space for garden areas/green areas. The big buildings at the border of the street protect the small ones behind them from noise from the street. Every big building itself has surfaces which do face the 'low noise' area of the settlement and therefore also profit from the thought of sound protection. Even though the design looks a little bit like a fortress, there are enough walkways to get easily through the settlement.
