This proposal seeks to create communities of 4 different and central nervous system developing on the idea of symbiosis. It is crucial for a community not to stay just connected with their neighbours but develop a sense of identity within a secondary social space. It is through such social space that allows a community to be self-sustaining and 'smarter'.  In addition, the scheme situates the entrance and alleys in conjunction with main roads to ensure ease of connectivity by transportations.
