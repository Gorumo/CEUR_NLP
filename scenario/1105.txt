No house is isolated in order to provide a sense of community, avoid loneliness perception and empower socialization. Nevertheless, houses are usually grouped in groups of 3 or 4 so as to strength dynamism. Even though it seems like some houses are surrounding the neighbourhood like a wall, there are many entraces to keep the neighbourhood open to the rest of the village. The neighbourhood is easy to cross (it is not an obstacle to mobility in any direction) but there are is also a triangular square in the middle east part of the neighbourhood for those who want to settle on.
