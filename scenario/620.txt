My principal idea was create spaces between the houses where the people can coexist sharing the front or sharing the backyard (green areas) With the purpose of create micro climates to refresh every house and it also allows greater security having open views from everywhere. I also pretend to create a center for everybody where the principals roads intersect (they are the continue of the existing street). Also they can access pedetrian from everywhere and generate 4 differents views depending of where you are or where they came.
