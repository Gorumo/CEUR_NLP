The waterfront is planned for open public paved space available for everybody. In the first line of the waterfront are the lower mixed use building and high raise towers. In the back are the high density mixed use buildings and office buildings. In between are the parks park connectors and paved open spaces. The commercial area is near to the waterfront and seafront paved area. Both neighborhood parks on the left and in the middle of the commercial areas are connected with water elements to the sea. Small bridges can be contracted to over pass the channels. Lower seafront buildings enable sea view to the higher buildings in the back. Between the busy highway boulevard and the buildings the green area shall be planned as tampon zone.
