My idea for this area was to create an urban area with green spaces between the blocks. Because of the climate in Singapore it was important to plan the housing areas around parks with their own subclimate. Another important idea I was trying to realize was the rising building hight. This has the effect that a lot of units, even at the back of the area, can see the sea. 
The density rises from outside to inside of this area.
