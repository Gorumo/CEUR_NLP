This proposal is based day to day communication, taking into consideration security and also densification through the consolidation of the sides that form the intersection from the principal street or node. I propose democratic spaces as you can see right top and also the left side. Both with the idea of connecting the cluster to its surroundings. Accessibility as you can see has no actually no hierarchies because the public spaces named before do not represent one.
