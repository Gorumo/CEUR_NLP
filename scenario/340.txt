I thought I would make just one big entrance from the street, from which to enter the whole compound. All the entrances to the houses would be towards the inside of the development to provide a bigger sense of privacy
There are three main recreational areas for everyone to use in between the buildings. I did not want to locate them next to the street because this would make them less exclusive, less safe and more noisy.
However, there could also be smaller entrances from the street to the interior if its necessary and maybe passages in between the blocks of buildings to ease mobility of the occupants around the area.

At first I thought about covering the whole side contiguous to the residential area but I thought that if this is a big community they might all want to share the space and if not, a fence or some high bushes might do the trick to provide the required privacy.

Finally, the sizes are not really precise due to the tool used but there should be a minimum distance between the sets of buildings to provide a certain fire safety and the buildings that are together should be counted as one whole building fire-wise.
