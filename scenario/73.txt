The goal of this design is to promote a university feel to the housing development. Universities in and of themselves are ecosystems of urban life and knowledge and campus layouts resemble the typical marketplace layout with the open quad for socializing and the maximization of view space to the inner quad from any building. The buildings here form the perimeter of the complex as well as a means to insulate the community and ensure that it is a protected environment from outer disturbances given the current social stigma toward poorer minorities the world over. In terms of infrastructure, the layout is also easy to serve due to the relatively linear connection of each building to the next while the entry points provide vistas for visibility to visitors and families keeping track of one another. The approximate orientation of each building also removes safety hazards such as hiding spots or inaccessible areas in the event of a fire and opens up all sides of each building as potential exit routes. The layout is also intentionally inhospitable to cars that would otherwise use the surrounding streets for parking or driving so as to minimize potential incidents from frequent pedestrian activity.
