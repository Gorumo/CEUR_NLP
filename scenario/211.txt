The design occupies the side of the plot to give the first degree of privacy and therefore of identification to the inhabitants. It allows also to interact between green to inhabitants. In the heart of the project, there are smaller houses with a smaller distance to allow a more green area to flow in between the buildings. Nevertheless, the settlement maintains a high degree of porosity and gains a large public place with its possibility of huge plazas between buildings. This public space could act as a catalyser of social interaction, as a recreational area or even allow for small shops, owned by the inhabitants to create a feeling of village life in the centre.
