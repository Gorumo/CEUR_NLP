the masterplan is organized as a series of street connected by each others through a network of plazas. This strategy allows a big connectivity and porosity for the entire plan. 
to avoid any wall effect the length of the build lines never exceed a certain distance. this create a good accessibility and connection with the inside and the outside of the plan. 
the series of plazas spread in the master plan create a series of centrality for every area. a main one in the center create a main point for the new area. each building is orientated according to the sun to get light but avoid the heat.
