The main idea is to mix the typologies as much as possible. The same typologies appear only in tiny groups together among other ones (here are HDBs and real estates meant!). The green spaces (with trees for shading especially) and the traditional typologies (Chinese shops) are understood as public spaces or joining elements which are being shared by both societies. By means of that, I would like to achieve that the city part is more lively and dynamic, so that there won't be areas which become "dead" during certain daytimes. And that is why also some traditional typologies are set among the business areas.
