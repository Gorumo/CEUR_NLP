The design is divided in 3 groups:
1- Low density (H=2.5m) residential-commercial to the east side of the terrain
2- Low density residential-agricultural with a front or back yard; located in the southwest along the road
3- High density (H=4m) residential-industrial (low)
The new configuration will give the welcome of the neigh-boor proximity by creating a public space renovation, through a system that give the welcome from the urban gates (corners and boundaries) to a central leisure public space core that will bring a new sense of appropriation and perception of the common areas; to the inhabitants of the project.
