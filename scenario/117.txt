I am providing a cross axis within the plot which will act as a connecting spine within the plot.The houses are clustered around three public spaces which are interconnected by the axis.It is seen to that all the units have ample of cross ventilation by keeping adequate spacing between the units and keeping the front and rear side open either towards the public  court or towards the road.An arm of the axis is kept open to the neighbourhood area to provide better interaction within communities.The tallest structures are placed at the end so as not to hamper the visibility of the rest.Assuming the plot to be barricaded , I am proposing only two entry points to the plot .All the units will be accessed from the internal courts which will result in better interaction between the residents  as well as enhance vigilance and usage of the courts.Vehicular access will be confined to the axis roads hence rendering the courts would safe for senior citizens and children
