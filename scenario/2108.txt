The project aims develop a walkable and communitarian settlement by combining housing units and creating built/unbuilt spaces. The alignment with the existing streets provides a better understanding of the neighborhood limits. The southern street is extended and connects the residential part of thi s city to the main artery. Perspectives though the new settlement are emphasized. Two types of central spaces can be characterized : the bigger one that could be used as a public multifunctional space (local markets, community event, etc) and three smaller intimate common spaces within the blocs. This densifed urban fabric allows us to use only half of the land plot and letting the other half for another development project.
