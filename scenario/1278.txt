As the proposal is to address the situation of a small neighborhood of informal settlements in Cape Town, I organized the space according to a planned social area in the center. From the streets and crossroads, I left free areas to enter the neighborhood, placing the larger buildings (mostly corresponding to school, health center, commerce) at the edges and smaller ones inside the neighborhood (housing). I also kept in mind to create a space for movement between buildings, promoting accessibility.
