My design focuses on offering the community with enough lighting, ventilation and open public areas while still providing security and privacy for their life.

The weather data from the location show that since Cape Town is in the southern hemisphere, the sun passes from East to West mostly through the North. Also in the area winds often flow from the SouthEast and NorthWest direction. 

In this presented proposal, houses are arranged into curved blocks which face mostly toward the North and Northeast in order to provide maximum sunlight, especially in the winter when the sun elevation angle is approximately 30 degrees at noon. Also, blocks are arranged in SouthEast to NorthWest direction to allow winds to flow freely through the area. In addition, the curved structure offers many open and private spaces to the community, since the shape of the blocks allows open yet partly covered spaces. When needed, an open space can be converted to private and vice versa. Finally, the design assures equal access to streets from all houses in which outside ones are pushed back to provide spaces for commercial/parking purposes.
