The main focus of this proposal was on the connectivity, so bringing all the green spaces, public transport stations together and therefore making sure the new district will be permeable enough to be livable. By placing the social housing and the traditional style houses along the green axis/the junction points and the rather luxurious (and often exclusive) buildings in between this design makes sure to enliven the public spaces and new streets which will be key to a livable city
