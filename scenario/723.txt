The idea was to create a neighborhood that would maximize sunlight, pedestrian/bicycle and traffic flow, and afford for at least two, preferably three, green spaces. I placed the tallest buildings at the back of the property as not to dwarf the smaller ones by placing them in the middle, while clustering like sized houses together to maximise outdoor patio/yard square footage. 

The layout is also an effort to move away from the traditional high density housing plans of the past by avoiding singularly large, connected buildings. I didn't want it to feel like a London council estate or the projects in Chicago, so I chose not to cluster the buildings closely together to give the tennants/owners a sense of individual space and identity. That said, I also tried to maintain the feeling of a community with shareable green space and walking, cycling and driving paths throughout. 

Cheers!
