This village has both shared communal space and smaller hamlets that are open and connected between Shak residents and visible to and from the surrounding neighbourhood. Height is maximised to allow light and eyes on the street for all residents. From the current scale it is hard to see if houses require a certain type of space around them, and what the surrounding environment scale is like, so it is hard to know if this design would be cramped or if the clusters allow more people movement and shared connection. the key is that people have closeness to next door neighbours as well as some open space and access between buildings and with the wider neighbourhood beyond Shak residents.
