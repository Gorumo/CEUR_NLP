Housing development with open high blocks lined to the streets, creating small courtyards in between, and making a strong urban image to the surroundings. In addition, lower density housing is proposed inside the plot with a large public park, giving a big quality open green space for the all neighbourhood. An internal pedestrian street, triangle shaped, communicates the different buildings, making a clear hierarchy of typologies, simplifying paths and connections.
