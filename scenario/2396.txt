A city or a community area should not only be well planned but should always have abundant congregation spaces so that the members of the society which include different age groups can sit, socialize and share their ideas with each other. A good idea will be to have a large open space/ landscaped ecological area which would only not bring employment opportunities but will also bring a sense of community and belongingness between each other.
