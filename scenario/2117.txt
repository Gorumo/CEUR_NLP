Roads are easily accessible.

There is space in the centre for the community to get together and exchange ideas and for the young to play and the teens to hang out. Great space to plant grass and a couple of trees. Even to make a small vegetable garden. The community should decide amongst themselves what they want to do there.

Doesn't look cramped - feels spacious

It feels safe. There are no barricades or houses that have become walls.
