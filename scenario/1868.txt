My idea is to improve walkability and community engagement by using public open space as the core principle of the urban plan. The design is POS-centric and tall buildings are located towards the edges of the site. That is, the site has a decreasing floor space index towards the center. The district is highly compact with a very large population. Therefore, it is essential that we use the space in an efficient and effective manner. I've only used a part of the site and the rest can be further developed. Also, being POS centric ensures the safety and security of the children. Especially from automobiles.
