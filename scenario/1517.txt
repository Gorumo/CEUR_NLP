The block has been designed following the concept of a private-public space, in order to both live the private space (private houses along the streets) and the public space (gathering areas, garden, block facilities e.g. school, library, pub, toilettes). 
The different residential buildings have been set parallel to the streets, with a distance of approximately 5-7 metres, to have enough area for the pavement and for a front area for the houses. Private space of 3 metres can be set in the rear of the houses as well. Both North-street houses and South-street houses nearly follow the North-South orientation (for which a proper south shading would be thought), meanwhile the West-street houses follow the East-West orientation (for which proper shading for each facade would be thought).
The angles of the block and where the context streets emerge, ideally crossing the block, have been emptied to give the idea of entrance to the block central gathering area. On the East side, the empty space behind the house is thought to be a garden area with a pub and toilettes, and other services (e.g. bike sharing). On the Central-West side, the bigger empty space is thought to be the social center of the block with school and a library, surrounded by garden areas and kid playground.
