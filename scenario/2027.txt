High density living to make room for interconnected green spaces, that break up the area into different housing districts, connect the new part of the city to the old one and make the bay area accessible to everyone. The idea was to block the view of the river as little as possible, thus buildings with a smaller height are placed near the river and the taller buildings toward the street. This configuration should also block out some street noise. I decided to not include any gated communities, as I like to think of this new city part as very open, interconnected and accessible to everyone.
