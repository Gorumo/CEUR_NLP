I designed the layout based on the type of community this place strives to become. It's not a posh locality and thus in an informal neighbourhood like this, the immediate neighbours become one's family. The units have been arranged in a pattern that 'Small clusters'(with no particular set/type of units). Each of these clusters have an open area (like a play area/sit out space/ courtyard) for themselves. But they are placed such that each of these are mutually accessible in terms of connectivity and visibility.

 The site has two main access roads through it. They are not perpendicular to the main roads in order to decrease visibility from outside(of the units and spaces between them for safety reasons). They decrease the distance to be travelled by each person to exit the site. There are smaller streets that connect and make each block accessible. I have assumed that the community is not gated, thus the clusters closest to these openings have been designed as introverted spaces(rather than completely open). 

All the clusters have been laid out around a central cluster which encloses a large playground(this can be landscaped and playground equipment can be installed)This can become a space used by the whole community and by people from all age groups. It has been given access on 4 sides.

Another criteria I kept in mind while planning was the North direction(approximately along that corner of the site that lies at the intersection of the main roads). South Africa has a rather hot climate and so in order to reduce heat gain in each block, I tried to refrain(in most cases) from orienting the longer sides of each block along East-West direction.
