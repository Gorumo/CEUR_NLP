Used low rise buildings close to waterfront to increase visibility to the water and wind flow through city (as opposed to over it). Connected green spaces allow for pedestrian traffic and additionally increase wind flow from waterfront. High density clusters have visibility to commercial retail and public transportation as well as the green spaces by the waterfront. Some consideration towards the road locations, but this needs further consideration.
