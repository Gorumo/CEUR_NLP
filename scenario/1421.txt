MASTER PLAN:

Creation of a central open green space which may include public amenities, making it equally accessible for all the residents as well as for service, since becomes accessible from all major streets.

All the taller buildings aligned to the north, taking in consideration of the sun light promoting passive shading.

EACH CLUSTER:
•	Consists of 8 to 10 structures.
•	The arrangement creates, a common courtyard, promoting social interaction but maintaining privacy at the same time and providing backyard for each of them.
•	The outer negative spaces of the cluster can be used of parking or other ancillary service practices, restricting only pedestrian movement inside the clusters as well as between two neighboring clusters  along their longitudinal axis.

HENCE, CENTRALITY, CONNECTIVITY, LIVABILITY ARE FOCUSED UPON IN THE PROGRAM.
