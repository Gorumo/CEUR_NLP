Green Concept:
The green is integrated with the building cluster to prevent heat island effect. One green pattern follows the waterside walk. Some green corridors between the buildings lead the air flow from sea to the site to inner part of the city. In every building cluster, there is a green courtyard which also will help to extract the heat between the buildings.

Building Concept:
Residential buildings are settled to the seaside and their hight increase with a  hierarchy to the inner part. The functions of the building are distributed to the urban site. Residential buildings are closer to the green corridors in relation to the sea. Bussines centers are more closer to the highway and main streets. the commercial buildings are linked with green corridors where the mass circulation is flowing.
