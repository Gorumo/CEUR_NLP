The community design is based on two important points. 
1. To allow adequate sunlight for all homes. Thus, the taller houses are placed in a way that they do not block the early morning sunlight coming from the east. 
2. Space for community gatherings. 3 spots have been demarcated for community gatherings. Two small spaces and one large space for the younger generation to play and interact. 

Additionally, with exception of a few homes, most homes are two side open allowing maximum light and ventilation.
