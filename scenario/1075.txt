This scheme gives priority to urban settlement, however all units were placed  in such a way that its long facades are oriented to open spaces.
Location following curved lines avoids boring views and and allow interesting expansions in streets  in the outside, especially in the corners where there is an extensive public space.
Higher units are located in the west part forming a cluster  and allowing the only direct pass (N-S) through of the terrain to separate it from the rest of the units.
Lower constructions clusters are designed to avoid other shortcut passing across the parcel, forming open internal spaces for recreation.
