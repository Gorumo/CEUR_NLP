On my project i try to take the buildings of 4meter and turn one face to the street because this way we concentrate the desity aroud the block.  This configuration creat small voids that could become playgrounds and comunity garden that encourage activities with neighbors. And i let another void to connect with a bicycle path and a sidewalk the other squares to the school, shortening the distance that a children have to walk and ensuring more security.
