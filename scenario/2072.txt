To design residential area for 70000 units I have chosen to combine building typologies together. The most special (extraordinary) building forms are situated in the middle and along the water side. The lowest building typologies (China Town and  Tiong Bahru) are close toe the excising city located to provide connection with the city. All (residential) building districts are connected with the city by roads infrastructure.
The offices buildings are divided in two parts and situated close to the roads infrastructure. The commercial buildings are presented in each part of the residential area to be used as for example a restaurant or a shop. The middle area can be used as recreation or out-going area. In the west part of the area there is a number of commercial buildings located to be used as shopping center.
The green areas are situated  in the each part of the area to provide livability.
