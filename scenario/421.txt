Situation:
On one side of the area, we can see the large buildings of the local school. The clear design and the size of the construction shows the importance of this institution; they establish the school as a key element in the area. 
Suggestion: 
The sketch suggests a more rigorous urban design in response to the nearby official buildings (school). This can create interesting open spaces between buildings, and hopefully help to structure a social and economic life in the neighborhood.
