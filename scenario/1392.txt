The idea is to form clusters of green spaces inside a group of houses, in that way people can share a common private/public spaces for the children to play and the adults to share with others, also in the left corner there is a public plaza for the citizen in general not as private as the green spaces in between the houses mentioned before. Also this idea provides a continuous facade along the perimeter.
