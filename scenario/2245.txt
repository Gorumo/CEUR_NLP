The layout here follows the logic's to densify towards the city side and slowly reducing density as you come close to the Sea side. The low density on the waterfront side provides better visibility and proportional human scale relatability and enhance views for high rises and dense buildings set a little back. The green edge along the water is to foresee the increasing levels of water, provide a public or private experience and lighter footprints. The small villas are given separate area with greens to create premium  spaces. Connectivity is enhanced by junctions with green buffers which relate to the biophilic characters. The sky scrapers area organized in angles to maximize the sea view as well as take the max. breeze in the spaces in response to the humid climate.China town sort of spaces are dispersed in between these zones to cater to better daily life cycles and to break the massive scales around. Overall the approach is to break the scale to human level as we approach the sea side.
