Following the typology of loosely arranged massing of small grained high density plots of buildings, this design attempts to break the paradoxical organic spatial planning yet formal and orthogonal arrangements through the expression seen in a free form plan. In addition, the spaces between masses creates porosity allowing social activity to transit within small pockets of space yet draw public into these social settings. This design resists the idea of dead ends where human circulation stops in hope to create a vibrant atmosphere while preventing opportunities for crime. Spaces between buildings also give opportunities for further expansion while suggesting all these massings need not be build concurrently for the ideas to be translated into physical form. Furthermore, a loosely packed collection of buildings allows for better ventilation, daylighting and from a more practical perspective of construction, tolerance is given to workers given the possibility of unfavourable site conditions.
