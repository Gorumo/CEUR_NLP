Still playing, but thinking in terms of creating 'groupings' within the buildings, and setting together in such a way that we can maximise the availability and utility of the open space - greening is so important - whilst maintaining  lines of sight and clear routes through the area to enhance the perception of safety.  By building the "blockade" along the road edges, the green interior space can become a haven.
