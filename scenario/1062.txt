Main idea is the reduction and not the elimination of the use introversion in the block in order to achieve the sustainability and viability.
I am trying to confront the issues of visibility, centrality, population density, accessibility and connectivity with the surrounding area.
This is accomplished in two ways:
a) The siting of the residential and the commercial activity.
b) The creation of common areas and of a pedestrian walkway along an East - West orientation axis with certain semiological meaning.
The siting of housing follows the building lines of the block along the street Njongo, Vukaki and Mlambo.
The siting of the commercial activities, is proposed along Njongo street only, with frontage on the specific road.
Inside the building block are formed the courtyards of the houses, the communal planted spaces and the planted pedestrian street that is running the entire length of the building block along the East-West axis. This axis is acting as the connecting link of the building block with the surrounding area and its uses, such as the school located on the opposite block.
