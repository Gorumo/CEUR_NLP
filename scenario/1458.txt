I wanted to create one big area where people could gather and have fun. I also designed two passages where people could easily walk through the lot. One of my biggest concern was the position of the sun so everyone would get natural sunlight, for this reason, I wanted to get some distance in-between buildings. The tallest buildings are located in the center so it wouldn't overshadow the others.
