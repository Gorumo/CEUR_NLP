The aim of this scheme is to foster SECURITY CONSCIOUSNESS and SOCIAL INTERACTION among the occupants, and at the same time provides space for the numerous social functions witnessed in communal area, such as play ground spaces for the kids in the neighbourhood, carols, vigils, parties, wedding ceremonies, thanksgiving etc. 
This scheme also ensures that the environment is properly ventilated, that is, the blocks are not too close to each other,  irrespective of the direction of the wind, and this is achieved by aligning the building heights accordingly. Also, the immediate vicinity of each block will be properly lightened, and as such, making it possible for individuals to see and know what is going on between any two blocks, thereby eliminating dark corners and alley, and consequently curbing any form of social vices that take place in the dark.
