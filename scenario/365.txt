I arranged the homes along all property lines, mixing up smaller and bigger masses to create green spaces in between households. The layout allows access (vehicular and pedestrian) from both surrounding streets. I also wanted defined roads allowing for each home to have a front and then shared sideyards and backyards with their neighbors.
