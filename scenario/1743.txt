The design is prepared by focusing on the distribution of road network and open space to the residential area. Also, by segregating the residential and institutional area, disturbance and notice pollution in residential area can be reduced. wide roads are provided according to the height of the buildings ( road which separate residential and institutional area is wider than internal roads provided in residential area). By arranging the buildings with same height will enhance aesthetic view of the area. Also provision of open space is there in residential area. which can be use for recreational purpose.
