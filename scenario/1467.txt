The idea was to arrange the locality in a way to establish a patter as well as a characteristic feature to it. Here, in my design I have alternatively placed the 4floor structures along with the 2.5 floor structures in a receding pattern. The idea was to add a funnelling effect for air to pass through the gaps of the two high settlement, as well as add a skyline like feature to the area. The elevation of the area will be significant in adding a characteristic visual to the location, other than obvious climatological benefits. Enclosing the 2.5 floor structured groups within 4 floor structures ensures that there is more interaction within the community, and it has been done in  a pattern to ensure minimal visual blockage as the buildings are placed alternatively. Simultaneously, the 4 floor structures enclosing the smaller structures impart a sense of security to the design for the residents. The receding vertical and horizontal layout will be beneficial in making this place a landmark.
