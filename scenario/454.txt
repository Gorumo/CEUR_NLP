I have taken the idea of shared spaces in which the housing will help to shape the "courtyards". My theory is that this way we may have more eyes on the public space which will allow for higher safety and community. The plot has two main "accesses" which will serve as well for casual encounters between neighbors and people in the community. 

Being an irregular polygon I wanted to have this approach over a more linear or orthogonal approach to experiment with this and modify the idea.
