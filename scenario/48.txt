The proposal creates mini-communities for residents to relate to and feel more connected to a smaller and closer number of people. It also organically interconnects those sub-communities with visual and walk-through corridors increasing the sense of safety, improved vistas and wider open public spaces.
The orientation and proximity of buildings have been considered to maximise building residents outside views and feeling of open space.
Finally, some buildings were located on the perimeter of the community boundaries to help define the community limits from the outside while maximising inclusion of public spaces with those subcommunity's pods.
