As the main problem is overall housing shortage in this region and one of our targets is to optimize the development area for further possibility of increasing the density of construction my main idea was to create a development pattern where each family has a small private piece of land that can be used for life quality improvement. To ease the habitats movements I've connected secondary streets with a driveway parallel to the main Njongo avenue. The first line of construction along Njongo avenue is done by blocked 2-story houses that also work as a noise barrier. The main concept of the layout is that houses are facing each other by the back wall and have a small private garden area in front of each of them.
