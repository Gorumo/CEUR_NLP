2nd design (use of all housing, not moving blue/yellow structures): 
1.) Main goal of 2nd attempt to fit all the housing types. All structures make up about 60K units (the exercise indicated up to 70K units place in this area!). 
2.) Design of park-like area near with a deliberate mix of turquoise and luxury housing, some clustering of types (but avoided boring layout by setting all six of the same housing types).
3.) Increasing height of structures from shoreline, HDB is the key building type used (also placed near railway stations), assuming streets and distribution needs of housing types. Streets/axis in part simulated with green park dots.
4. ) Low rise settlement near yellow business but somewhat away from blue business towers.
5.) Development of a second luxury area in the NW part of the area with access to green park stretch.
