Ok, an aerial inspection shows this part is the central part of the city which usually consists of two sectors: All Government Offices and Institutions the Banks, Justice Courts, Library, Town Hall etc. I designed this region in a way that allows for a cool breeze from north-east in summers and to block chilly winter winds from the south-west. This will save energy consumption in air conditioning (or so that was the idea behind it)

1. Visibility, having placed all shorter buildings on the periphery and arranging taller buildings in criss-cross pattern allows most of the visibility for the skyline of the area.

2. Centrality, there is an entry point to the area though south-east, which leads into an open space right at the centre. All the buildings are accessible from there and are equidistant. Also, some buildings which house certain offices like The Town Hall, needs access to public gatherings and also need to be closer to other institutions, so they are situated at the east side of the section.

3. Connectivity, covered in point 2

4. Accessibility, we can construct walkways through the buildings which allow easy access from the centre of the section.
