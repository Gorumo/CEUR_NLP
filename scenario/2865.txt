Herewith I summarize some of the key elements of my design:

- The West Coast Highway is flanked by offices and high density mixed use buildings. This is to block the visiblity of heavy traffic and minimize the noise in this new urban development.
- The green space of the Mt Faber park continues in a city park by means of park connectors. This is the only point where the highway is not shielded off. Thus the long strips of pork within the cities can also streth out to the former container terminal in Tanjong Pagar.
- The park connector continues alongside the coast, combined with cultural attractions, water elements and commercial buildings in the vicinity. The backbone of this new city development is actually this green corridor which has a strong relation to the water side and buildings that are open to the public. This is where the street life is concentrating. At the same time it is a 'green entrance' into the new city development for pedestrians and light traffic.
- More inlands, there is a paved open space that is a connecting route for vehicles between the existing residential district Cantonment and the West Coast Highway. This connection fixes the new city development into the urban tissue and it has mixed-use and commercial buildings on either sides. In bewteen two cultural attractions in the middle, it has a view towards the water. This is also where fresh air comes into the new city development.
- There is not a strong relation with the VivoCity mall and the Sentosa gateway as these are typically large scale leisure and commercial areas that attracts people who come by car from more distant parts of the city. They city development I created is a different kind of neighbour so to speak.
