My idea is that we can organize the construction in a way that we save spaces for nature, parks and other thing if we take a kind of module organization.

Also, this organization let the constructions be closer, so that their inhabitants can easly comunnicate and interact with each others, if we take the constructions in a module organization it is easy to take information from the diferent modules and make decissions about that information in order that the owners make a it better place to live.
