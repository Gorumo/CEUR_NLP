The main idea was to address the neighbourhood factor,
1. I have placed all green covers adjacent to water so that in future one can create waterfront development and a kind of a recreational place.
2. I have segregated commercil and residentioal activities.
3. I have placed all high rise blocks in such a manner that they get a green space as well as a view towards the water.
4. At the communal level, I have provided theme park at a larger level so that neighborhood people can also join.
5. Cultural attraction is placed in such a way that it get that highlighting factor and everyone can see by passing through that area.
6. Green areas are very important in consideration of good and healthy future life.
