This is my proposed site plan,  I considered the following
1) Accessibility to  individual houses
2) Distance of houses from the road
3) Community relationship; The houses have to be placed in a way it would encourage community gatherings, children play ground and so on
4) Sunrise and Sunset and also the North-East and South-West trade winds; these helped in the placing of the buildings without having any conflict with nature
