My concept is to promote permeability through the site - with openings on each side of each major street surrounding the site. Large 2 stories buildings are featured on corners to promote opportunities for businesses on the first floor in high traffic areas. An enclosure in the center of space provides opportunity for a park / common space. Spacing of housing ensures space for stoop/porch and reduces fire risk.
