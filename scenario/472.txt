When we talk about smart cities all I am concerned with is livability. Making cities more human. Socially and psychologically people like communities  and make them on many scales. My idea was to create small communities within the larger one and allow for the creation of a larger one with the central “square”. Accessibility and human interaction were my leading concepts. 
Good connections with inner and outer streets are achieved for all houses. Inner square draws people inside while the tall buildings in the back provide better visualization and bring in more sunlight.
