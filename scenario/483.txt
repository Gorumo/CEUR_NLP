The placement of the higher building on the street edges reduces the noise pollution. Gaps between the buildings allow a porosity through this "noise barrier" and connect the inner part to the city. 

A second layer of building, which would work as social housing system, direct the visitors to the different part of the system, dividing the flux of people. The two big empty space in the centre are thought as parks to bring the inhabitant together and allow a big part of bring into the neighbourhood. 

The last part, with smaller in size and height building, would work as link with the rest of the urban organisation of the district, meeting a more individual housing typology.
