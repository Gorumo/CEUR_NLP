I've aimed to maintain the individual household structure while enhancing the feeling of community. I've therefore based my design around the addition of two small cross-streets/access walkways in order to maximise the distance between homes. This minimises the chance of fire spreading given local cooking practices, while also creating open space for outdoor socialising, gardening, etc. Cultural expectations of density seen in the surrounding buildings (shaded grey) have been maintained. Security is also maintained as there are no uninhabited access areas that could be used to reach the rear of buildings undetected by neighbours in the community.
