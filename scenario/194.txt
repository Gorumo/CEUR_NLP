Very new to this but finding it fascinating. I have approached this with simplicity. I am obviously trapped in a realm of Pythagorean Idealism. The smaller dwellings form an inner-ring of shared space with the larger dwellings on the perimeter. My intention is to create an area of shared space whilst giving each dwelling as much of its own space as possible. Not an easy trade-off. 

I have been living in a post-Soviet district of Berlin for the last few years so the sense of order and symmetry is clearly influential. I wanted to prioritise the idea of macro-space for the whole community rather than subdividing the space too much. Clearly I have only partially succeeded in that. I am sure there are many more considerations which I hope to learn throughout the X-Series. 

The video on the project itself was very interesting and would love to learn more about its progress.
