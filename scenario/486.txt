The main idea is to provide the settlement with a public space in the center (like a market or something) that would bring people from other neighborhoods to come in, in order to avoid this quarter to close itself to the surrounding.
The more urban typologies of buildings are located along the roads to make a clear gesture on the urban scale, and with offsets to make the whole uncongested. These buildings are also disposed in blocks, permitting them to host in their center an enjoyable and shaded area for the inhabitants. They are also arranged in a way to prevent the spaces between them to be boring corridors. Moreover, the more you approach the angle of the settlement, the lower the buildings tend to be, making the angle more open to the outside world. Behind this belt of blocks stands the public space, accessible to anybody from the two roads. And behind that, the smaller scale of buildings can be found, also organized around a small shared space. These small buildings can profit from the shadows and the lack of wind and noise provided by the bigger buildings.
