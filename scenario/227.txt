The Central Business District will be located at the center where there will be buildings to serve as office block as well as stalls and shops for the community's main market. From some parts of the community, the distance to the CBD is of trekable distance to reduce the need for transports which would reduce pollution as well as encourage a better lifestyle of exercise.

The community park is located opposite the central business district (CBD) for easy accessibility to every individual in the community as the major roads that form the community border on this plot of land. It will be landscaped beautifully to achieve functionality in creating a healthy environment as well as serve as a form of relaxation for the community.

The residential buildings are so arranged that they are accesible to at least a road. Houses are located close to each other for communal reasons and interaction between the residents which will encourage participatory planning as everyone knows almost everyone who lives on their street. In order to accommodate more people without reducing the standard of each building two story buildings were used for the design.
