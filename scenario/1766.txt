Creating clusters of 5 to 6 houses, and a common space in between will provide a common space for interaction, visually and even physically. 4m wide roads going all over the site, having half a metre wide footpath on both the sides, makes up a 5m wide buffer between every two houses. Also, providing a common open area or community space for the whole Empower shack project, inorder to make all people come closer and together because after all, the more united you are now, the more successful you will become then.
