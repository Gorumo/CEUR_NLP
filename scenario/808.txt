The first idea that came to my mind was to put the highest and biggest buildings in the back to facilitate natural light for the small ones. The reason why I decided to start organising from the perimeter was to be able to create as many common share spaces as possible that anybody can have access to. Also, for security reasons I considered that splitting up the zone would ease things up.
