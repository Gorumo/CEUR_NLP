The main proposal is to create a masterplan that the citizens have a better quality of live. To design this idea, I thought that, first, we have to interligate the green areas along the boardwalk. Therefrom we use this green areas to encourage the citizens to pratice sports activities, making this space, more usefull for all the citizens. 
Second, thinking about the local climate, we design buildings with low height along the green areas to preserv the visibility and the ventilation to the buildings farther from the sea. Third, studying the height of the buildings next to the masterplan, I found the best place to implant the highest buildings, that it is, exacly,  the same place. Because the impact will be minor, and we centralized this area with the highest buildings.
