My proposal is based on 3 statements.
1. The first of them, the interior public space, as space of relationship between the inhabitants and extension of their homes.
2. The front built on the borders of the patch. As a symbolic element and attention for the place.
3. The two main avenues, where mid-scale buildings standing and lead you to the two large public spaces for the city.
