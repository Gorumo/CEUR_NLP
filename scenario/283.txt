I tried to concentrate most building (those larger volumes) in the environment of the streets and in the center, leaving minors to the contact areas with the rest of the existing building. On the other hand, I tried to go creating a reticle that also leave open spaces such as squares. In a way, I have tried to create a higher density centrality in an interior point more links with the streets with the rest of the existing building and built environment. At the same time, I have also tried to create a certain mixture of types of buildings.
