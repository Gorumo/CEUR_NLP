The Idea is was to have a great visibility for the project by creating an access to the project in the intersection of the two roads by using a composition of high blocs.
To enhance the accessibility two aces were created in each street. We can go thought the project by taking a short walk than contouring the whole project. So that gives more dynamic to the heart of the project.
A central green space is created. And the residential blocs are disposed around it in a spontaneous way but with a certain degree of flexibility. In the one hand we have rigid blocs and in the other hand porous blocs to guaranty the intimate of residential parts and in the same time two enhance interaction with exterior parts.
