I can't rotate buildings for some reason, nor move or create green spaces (using MacBook touchpad, see comment on MOOC). However, this design is intended to lead the southwest monsoon winds through the first building lines into the neighborhood streets and breaking them with the next line of buildings to achieve some cooling effect without too much building up of the air currents. Buildings are lower near the shore as to allow a better view to the taller ones behind. Shopping areas are spread through the area to reduce transportation use and time (ideally residencial and office functions should be spread). Some facilities of the current port could be preserved as attractions or rehabilitated into leizure spaces.
