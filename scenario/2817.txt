The empty space in the center serves as a square or a public space. A few of the residential blocks are facing the square to keep the community alive and safe. The neighborhood is planned in a way that there's no residential area or houses that are closed off/ blocked from the rest of the community. All the housing blocks are easily accessible from the main road, the square and the schools.
