There is clearly a lot of activity going on at the Njongo Avenue due to the Primary and Secundary Schools. It also is one of the main roads in the overall neighborhood so the higher (2 storey) building blocks are mostly positioned alongside this axis. This will allow (informal) businesses to start at ground floor level while people can live at the back sides of the property or on the 1st floor. The higher buildings also shield of the rest of the neighborhood to create a more quite environment for community activities such as urban farming. An additional road is introduced dividing the urban cluster in two. This will be an additional route towards the schools. Two large 'urban courtyards' are created as a result, with the larger one containing the smallest building blocks. The overall urban layout could possibly improve the living situation of the people as there is more space in the right locations for private activities (behind the buildings in the 2 urban courtyards) and (informal) businesses.
