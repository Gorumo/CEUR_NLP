I believe that the most practical way to improve the living conditions of the people in this neighborhood is to improve accessibility for all the houses that make up the area by removing the houses that were off the main streets. This factor may work if people from homes located off the main avenues come to own automotive vehicles, that they do not put their vehicles on the street because of lack of accessibility to garages. Another factor was that when locating the houses near the main avenues the use of means of mass transportation is better used, causing people to have bus stops closer to their houses, thus increasing the use of these transports due to the same bring more Benefits to the residents.

One factor that I believe to be disruptive is the creation of an empty space in the middle of the block that became "inaccessible" to new housing and would eventually become a "lost space".
