On both sides, I did not put dense buildings because I wanted people to be able to view what is at the end of both sides of the road. Singapore is a humid country, so I thought it would be nice to make a line of parks on both sides to get to offices and residents so pedestrians can feel a little cooler on their way. On the west side, I put the residential place at the back of the park. So there can be eyes watching the park at night, and can keep the park a safe place. The commercial area next to the residential area are both for the residents and people at the park. For the mixed uses, I put lower buildings on the beach side so all buildings have a view to the canal. The East is more for offices, and I tried to put some kind of open space between the offices so people can have lunch outside if they feel like so.
