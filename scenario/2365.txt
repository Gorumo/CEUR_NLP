I inspired my idea in my country's capital, Brasilia, the smartest city that I know. 
Separating the buildings that way, you can go to your destination faster, doesn't mater where it is.  the central space can be used as a plaza where people can socialize and make they neighborhood  closely.
I separated those taller buildings thinking there lives more people, so they need a better access to streets and the school around.
