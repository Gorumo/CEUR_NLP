Locate as many of the blocks as possible, but failing to accommodate every one, prioritise high rise, high density over historical models (Tiong Bahru and Chinatown). Group the highest foot-traffic functions, the office buildings and retail, near the red bars which I have assumed to be MRT stations. Extend the office towers from the existing CBD, capitalising on the prestige of this location. Similarly place the lowest rise at the north west of the site, proximate to the original neighbourhoods. Group the retail into mall-scale objects similar to Vivocity to the west and not requiring water frontage. Use linear green space as a proxy for streets, give every building a street or water frontage. Pair blocks where possible to give internal gardens with more privacy. Prioritise pedestrian access to the waterfront (permeability of public domain access and protection of views). Arrange buildings to maximise water views – higher buildings near the water as low-rise typologies enjoy a different type of experience (garden view). Give absolute water frontage to some of the condominium blocks for economic reasons – the higher value of these blocks will help finance the public housing.
