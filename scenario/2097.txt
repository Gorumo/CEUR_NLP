The small neighbourhood in Cape Town can be enhanced by creating an urban grid, that allows courtyards or green pockets within the dense blocks. Green pockets are meant to increase the quality of life, they gather and bond the community and bring joy to the neighbourhood. (Connectivity) 

Urban Grid will make the slum area more efficient in terms of energy and water distribution. It connects the residential in a Smart way. (Distribution) 

The Superblocks are strategically placed according to the existing street and pathways, to create urban porosity. This will enable the community to walk through the cluster to reach the two schools. (Accessibility & Visibility) 

A community park can be proposed at the intersection grid of the secondary and primary school. Giving full visibility towards the two schools will enhance the security of the children. Moreover, this community park can act as the meeting point for parents while waiting for their kids. (Centrality)
