My design took in consideration the following conditions/restrictions:
- Mendi CI street on Google map
- buildings should be grouped because the biggest problems of the area are:
 water accessibility and security.
- each group should have access to the main streets for cars providing different services or bike path access.

Of course that these restrictions have decreased the level of visibility and/or the density to some extent.
One should not analyze the design only by the criteria, but to analyze it taking into consideration the restrictions too.
