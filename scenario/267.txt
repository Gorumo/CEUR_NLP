In my urban design I made little groups of buildings, this it to make better use of space. On the other hand, I wanted using the free spaces for green areas, leisure activities and recreation areas. It is important create special areas for coexistence among the inhabitants. When you use this areas  you can feel more community between neighbors and the
appropriation of space.
