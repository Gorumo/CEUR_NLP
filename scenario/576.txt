I tried to fullfill the following conditions:
- direct access to streets for each unit (prevention of isolation)
- streets that lead through the neighbourhood in order to connect this site to the others (prevention of gated communities)
- enough space for a backyard behind each unit
- private zones (inside the blocks)
- in the middle the streets open up to a public zone. this allows social gatherings (market, stores)
- the buildings stand close to each other (allows shaded zones and facades)
- the taller buildings are placed around the square (e.g.: grocery stores on the street level)
