It is important to develop a connective, and simultaneously, visible neighborhood by connective focal points which can play as inclusive spaces. These inclusive spaces meet sustainability principles by providing social linkage, green environment (i.e. packet parks, green lands, urban farms, etc.), and also, economic sensitive systems (i.e. applying PV solar systems which can help save electrical and fuel energy sources).
