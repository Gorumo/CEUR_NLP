The houses have been clustered into a few subclusters with a shared 'backyard' which could house some communal facilities. The aim of this is to create a safer space where neighbours interact and watch over each others children and pets and possibly even have little community vegetable gardens. There are also a few alleys converging to a central open area which would most probably be the location for playing sports or making a barbeque (shisa nyama/braai) or where the local spaza shop will be located.
