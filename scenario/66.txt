The buildings are surrounded with enough free space  so that it is possible to enter from different sides or positions. There are walkways between the buildings to allow a better finding of the different offices and Banks and Instituitions they are in the center of town  - everything is easy to reach and neatly arranged. I missed colours to make a difference in the size of the buildings. <In the smal buildings there are Kindergarden and schools wheras in the big buidlings are banks and huge companies.
