Visibility, accessibility and connectivity are important criteria of urban design. In order to achieve them I have chosen to place the buildings with the height of 4m (two story houses) along Njongo Ave street. Following Google Maps the school and nursery are situated on the other side of the street. 
The Njongo Ave street is faced to North-East. This orientation provides the most possible shade from the sun. 
The residential buildings along Mlambo street are situated with the facade in the South-East direction. This orientation provides the sun om the face of the house in the morning, when the sun power is not very strong. 
The buildings can be supplied by sun power generation systems: electrical or thermal. 
In the order of connectivity and accessibility there is a possibility of public transport to achieve schools and small shopcenter in the neighborhood, but also this living district. 
The centrality of another design criteria. For common services a number of buildings are placed in the midden of the living district. The midden area of the district can be use for ''green'' activities such as vegetable garden or recreations or sports.
In the corner of Mlambo and Vucani street there are the residential buildings placed for people whom needs care. The services buildings for example medical assistance are situated nearly. 
On the other site (small side, corner of Njongo Ave and Mlambo Street) there are a number of common buildings placed (for example bakery of other workshop space).
