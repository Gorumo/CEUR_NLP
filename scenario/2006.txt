Having more construction space available and needing to generate a return on investment for every new square kilometre won from the sea is a tough challenge. To keep the Heat Island Effect under control and the city climate on a more comfortable level there need to be corridors for natural wind flows as well as greeneries for fresher air and shading. Parks are also providing additional ecosystem services for both human inhabitants and other "users", as well as for the city's fauna. People need recreational areas and spaces where they can meet and interact with each other and get a sense of "nature" to relax.
A good mixture of all walks of life shall help to create a feeling of togetherness and healthy community, instead of exclusion. But to give real-estate investors a reason to put money in this new part of the town they need to be offered incentives via higher revenues with more luxurious residential projects, while areas like e.g. chinatowns add quality for all the community by providing food, amusement and the like, and more affordable homes guarantee access to life in a modern, healthy city, with jobs nearby.
