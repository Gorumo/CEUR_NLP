The idea is to divide the community into areas with blocks and others with single units.  The zigzag format also lends the neighbourhood some character which would be lacking with straight lined buildings.  The spaces left in between would serve for green areas, play areas and some parking.  In all, the arrangement brings sanity, unlike before, though not completely removing the bit of 'chaos' which could just be a part of the people's lifestyle.
