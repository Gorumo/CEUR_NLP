My ideas are as follows:
1. to give space to each and every block from both front and back side. 
2. to have large access points from corners and in the middle to each unit for emergencies and services.
3. locating the big blocks on the main road opposite to the schools for two reasons: they don't obstruct the scenery (green areas between the units) in front of smaller units and obstructing the noise coming from schools to the rest of the area.
4. having enough walking and entertainment areas in the center of this settlement
