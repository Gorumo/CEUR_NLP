My design evolved around the idea of a different understanding fo housing typologies. In fact, rather than following the street path or gathering the blocks in rectangular shapes, the presented design offers a curved assemblage of blocks wich are rotated mostly toward south, south-east with their longer face. This structure offers  a multitude of desing opportunities as the blocks connected vary in shape, height and lenght. Also,  it offers a lot of open and free pubblic space that, given the shapes of the blocks gives the opportunity  for more control of the open spaces . The whole complex enhances  diversity, new human and infrastructural connections and innovative housing design solutions.
