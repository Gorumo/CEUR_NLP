Taking into account the existence of the two schools across the street, my proposal tries to adapt the location of the buildings to the flows generated by these equipments.
In such a way, the buildings are arranged allowing the creation of a generous living area inside the block, which remains connected with the other roads and buildings, allowing greater security to the residents and passers-by. In addition, the larger buildings were placed facing the main road, seeking a mixed use, with commerce and housing.
