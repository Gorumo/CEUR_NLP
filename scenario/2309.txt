Buildings are aligned to north-south direction to take advantage of North-light. Services can be in the west side. Space can be allotted for greenery/ growing food/ parking in the back and front of the plot. One main access splits the site. The tall buildings are towards the central spline of the plot---if other houses were to add another level, there would be a consistent eye level as the backdrop.
