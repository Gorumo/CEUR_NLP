This design is based on a spider web configuration to build 6 main public spaces dotted with a few building which have public functions (theaters, markets, museums etc...). The design builds to a main central building with large public amenities and the entire place is designed to have green roofs, and since so many buildings are interconnected this space is particularly vast, providing residents with a second large area of public space on top of the six main public areas at the ground level. The entire design is open through gaps, so people can walk in freely from outside. The area and the space can thus be used by the entire neighbourhood and does not feel as a closed or gated design.
