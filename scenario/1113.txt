the main idea is to improve the area and the community inside. The siteplan is designed to make the buildings more in order while still maintaining the village feeling for the residents. The area is designed to have some open space for the community that can be easily accessed from the residential complex, because this is the heart of the area where people gather to socialized and for children to play. 
The bigger mass/building will be placed near the main road, on the perimeter of the site. The smaller buildings will be placed near the communal space. The residential complex is designed as a colony of small compunds, consist of 4-6 houses. The small compound of house make sure the residents have a good access to the communal space. This layout also make the area feels more open.
