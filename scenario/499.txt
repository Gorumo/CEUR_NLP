This proposal is based on the placement of the buildings in a way that could make the development project attractive to the neighbors, facilitating their daily life, trying to connect them with the other neighborhoods and creating spaces that could generate economic growth. The design results from the following ideas:
Create public space: One central square, looking for interaction with outsiders, with good accessibility from the main streets, prone to hold markets or shops. Four more squares, which are more likely to encourage interaction among neighbors, where green spaces, sport facilities, kids zones, etc. should be created.
Allow the pass of vehicles as police, ambulances, firefightersâ€¦ and the passage for section outsiders.
Avoid in the possible dangerous spaces for security, trying to look for clear and big spaces.
Permeability in order to permit people of other sections enter and participating into the open spaces. Low houses in the main streets looking for interaction with pedestrians, also doing more pleasant for the pedestrian to walk through these streets.
