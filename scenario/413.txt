The spatial distribution gravitates around the the axis that the reoad that ends on meeting the block proposes and the corner wich will not be filled with houses. The corner creates a shared space with the community and it's urban surrounding, its followed by a bigger one for a sense of privacy wich can still be seen narrowed by the houses around it. This distribution creates four axes that constitute the circulation around the houses and ultimately unfolds in a big "L" shaped plaza. Without knowing the developtment of the excercises of the following weeks, I would dare to propose this "L" internal plaza as an Urban Farming place.
