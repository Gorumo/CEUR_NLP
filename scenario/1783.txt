The design is incorporating the road which is currently dissecting the area, as seen on Google maps. Furthermore, it considers the impact of the sun's path, both in summer, where shade is more necessary and in winter where the sunlight is more useful. It is important to keep other environmental conditions in mind, such as the prevailing wind direction. During the winter it is going towards the south-east, and during the summer it is heading towards the north. Therefore, a design which utilises this prevailing wind helps regulate the neighbourhood temperature and comfort. The design does all this by having taller structures to west, south-west, to minimise the strength of the early Sun on surrounding communal and housing areas. There are large open spaces to create communal areas for the local population to utilise, to improve the community social atmosphere and productivity. The design provides walkways towards the school north of the site. All housing has access to the communal spaces. In addition, they are separated from the roads, to provide front space for the structures, for parking and to create a greater sound barrier to traffic noise pollution. The design has the buildings placed further back from the corners of intersections as these are generally areas for pedestrians to cross, in addition to increasing safety by having greater visibility for drivers around corners.
